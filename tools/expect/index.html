<p>Expect is a tool for automating interactive applications according to a script.
Following the script, Expect knows what can be expected from a program and what
the correct response should be. Expect is also useful for testing these same
applications. And by adding Tk, you can also wrap interactive applications in
X11 GUIs. An interpreted language provides branching and high-level control
structures to direct the dialogue. In addition, the user can take control and
interact directly when desired, afterward returning control to the script.</p>
<p>This package contains the expect binary and several Expect based scripts.</p>

AUTOEXPECT(1)               General Commands Manual              AUTOEXPECT(1)

NAME
       autoexpect - generate an Expect script from watching a session

SYNOPSIS
       autoexpect [ args ] [ program args...  ]

INTRODUCTION
       autoexpect  watches you interacting with another program and creates an
       Expect script that  reproduces  your  interactions.   For  straightline
       scripts,  autoexpect  saves  substantial  time  over writing scripts by
       hand.  Even if you are an Expect expert, you will find it convenient to
       use autoexpect to automate the more mindless parts of interactions.  It
       is much easier to cut/paste hunks of autoexpect scripts  together  than
       to write them from scratch.  And if you are a beginner, you may be able
       to get away with learning nothing more about Expect than  how  to  call
       autoexpect.

       The  simplest way to use autoexpect is to call it from the command line
       with no arguments.  For example:

            % autoexpect

       By default, autoexpect spawns a shell for you.  Given  a  program  name
       and arguments, autoexpect spawns that program.  For example:

            % autoexpect ftp ftp.cme.nist.gov

       Once your spawned program is running, interact normally.  When you have
       exited the shell (or program that you specified), autoexpect will  cre-
       ate a new script for you.  By default, autoexpect writes the new script
       to &quot;script.exp&quot;.  You can override this with the -f flag followed by  a
       new script name.

       The  following  example  runs &quot;ftp ftp.cme.nist.gov&quot; and stores the re-
       sulting Expect script in the file &quot;nist&quot;.

            % autoexpect -f nist ftp ftp.cme.nist.gov

       It is important to understand that  autoexpect  does  not  guarantee  a
       working script because it necessarily has to guess about certain things
       - and occasionally it guesses wrong.  However, it is usually very  easy
       to identify and fix these problems.  The typical problems are:

              o   Timing.   A  surprisingly large number of programs (rn, ksh,
                  zsh, telnet, etc.) and devices (e.g.,  modems)  ignore  key-
                  strokes  that  arrive  &quot;too  quickly&quot; after prompts.  If you
                  find your new script hanging up at one spot,  try  adding  a
                  short sleep just before the previous send.

                  You  can  force  this  behavior throughout by overriding the
                  variable &quot;force_conservative&quot; near the beginning of the gen-
                  erated  script.   This  &quot;conservative&quot; mode makes autoexpect
                  automatically pause briefly (one tenth of a  second)  before
                  sending  each character.  This pacifies every program I know
                  of.

                  This conservative mode is useful if you just want to quickly
                  reassure  yourself  that  the problem is a timing one (or if
                  you really don't care about how fast the script runs).  This
                  same  mode  can  be forced before script generation by using
                  the -c flag.

                  Fortunately, these timing spots are rare.  For example, tel-
                  net  ignores  characters  only after entering its escape se-
                  quence.  Modems only  ignore  characters  immediately  after
                  connecting  to  them for the first time.  A few programs ex-
                  hibit this behavior all the time but typically have a switch
                  to  disable it.  For example, rn's -T flag disables this be-
                  havior.

                  The following  example  starts  autoexpect  in  conservative
                  mode.

                       autoexpect -c

                  The  -C flag defines a key to toggle conservative mode.  The
                  following example  starts  autoexpect  (in  non-conservative
                  mode)  with  ^L as the toggle.  (Note that the ^L is entered
                  literally - i.e., enter a real control-L).

                       autoexpect -C ^L

                  The following example starts autoexpect in conservative mode
                  with ^L as the toggle.

                       autoexpect -c -C ^L

              o   Echoing.  Many program echo characters.  For example, if you
                  type &quot;more&quot; to a shell, what autoexpect actually sees is:

                       you typed 'm',
                       computer typed 'm',
                       you typed 'o',
                       computer typed 'o',
                       you typed 'r',
                       computer typed 'r',
                       ...

                  Without specific knowledge of the program, it is  impossible
                  to  know if you are waiting to see each character echoed be-
                  fore typing the next.  If autoexpect sees  characters  being
                  echoed,  it  assumes  that  it  can send them all as a group
                  rather than interleaving them the way  they  originally  ap-
                  peared.   This makes the script more pleasant to read.  How-
                  ever, it could conceivably be incorrect if you really had to
                  wait to see each character echoed.

              o   Change.   Autoexpect records every character from the inter-
                  action in the script.  This is desirable  because  it  gives
                  you  the  ability to make judgements about what is important
                  and what can be replaced with a pattern match.

                  On the other hand, if you use commands whose output  differs
                  from  run  to run, the generated scripts are not going to be
                  correct.  For example, the &quot;date&quot;  command  always  produces
                  different  output.   So using the date command while running
                  autoexpect is a sure way to produce a script that  will  re-
                  quire editing in order for it to work.

                  The  -p  flag  puts  autoexpect into &quot;prompt mode&quot;.  In this
                  mode, autoexpect will only look for the  the  last  line  of
                  program  output - which is usually the prompt.  This handles
                  the date problem (see above) and most others.

                  The following example starts autoexpect in prompt mode.

                       autoexpect -p

                  The -P flag defines a key to toggle prompt mode.   The  fol-
                  lowing  example  starts autoexpect (in non-prompt mode) with
                  ^P as the toggle.  Note that the ^P is entered  literally  -
                  i.e., enter a real control-P.

                       autoexpect -P ^P

                  The  following example starts autoexpect in prompt mode with
                  ^P as the toggle.

                       autoexpect -p -P ^P

OTHER FLAGS
       The -quiet flag disables informational messages produced by autoexpect.

       The -Q flag names a quote character which can be used to enter  charac-
       ters  that  autoexpect would otherwise consume because they are used as
       toggles.

       The following example shows a number of flags with quote used  to  pro-
       vide a way of entering the toggles literally.

            autoexpect -P ^P -C ^L -Q ^Q

STYLE
       I  don't  know if there is a &quot;style&quot; for Expect programs but autoexpect
       should definitely not be held up as any model of style.   For  example,
       autoexpect  uses  features of Expect that are intended specifically for
       computer-generated scripting.  So don't try to faithfully write scripts
       that  appear as if they were generated by autoexpect.  This is not use-
       ful.

       On the other hand, autoexpect scripts do show some  worthwhile  things.
       For  example, you can see how any string must be quoted in order to use
       it in a Tcl script simply by running the strings through autoexpect.

NAME
       Dislocate - disconnect and reconnect processes

SYNOPSIS
       dislocate [ program args...  ]

INTRODUCTION
       Dislocate  allows  processes  to be disconnected and reconnected to the
       terminal.  Possible uses:

              o   You can disconnect a process from a terminal at work and re-
                  connect from home, to continue working.

              o   After  having your line be dropped due to noise, you can get
                  back to your process  without  having  to  restart  it  from
                  scratch.

              o   If  you  have a problem that you would like to show someone,
                  you can set up the scenario at your  own  terminal,  discon-
                  nect, walk down the hall, and reconnect on another terminal.

              o   If  you are in the middle of a great game (or whatever) that
                  does not allow you to save, and someone else kicks  you  off
                  the terminal, you can disconnect, and reconnect later.

USAGE
       When run with no arguments, Dislocate tells you about your disconnected
       processes and lets you reconnect to one.  Otherwise, Dislocate runs the
       named program along with any arguments.

       By default, ^] is an escape that lets you talk to Dislocate itself.  At
       that point, you can disconnect (by pressing ^D)  or  suspend  Dislocate
       (by pressing ^Z).

       Any  Tcl or Expect command is also acceptable at this point.  For exam-
       ple, to insert the contents of a the file /etc/motd as if you had typed
       it, say:

            send -i $out [exec cat /etc/motd]

       To send the numbers 1 to 100 in response to the prompt &quot;next #&quot;, say:

            for {set i 0} {$i&lt;100} {incr i} {
                expect -i $in &quot;next #&quot;
                send -i $out &quot;$i\r&quot;
            }

       Scripts  can  also be prepared and sourced in so that you don't have to
       type them on the spot.

       Dislocate is actually just a simple Expect script.  Feel free  to  make
       it do what you want it to do or just use Expect directly, without going
       through Dislocate.  Dislocate  understands  a  few  special  arguments.
       These  should appear before any program name.  Each should be separated
       by whitespace.  If the  arguments  themselves  takes  arguments,  these
       should also be separated by whitespace.

       The  -escape flag sets the escape to whatever follows.  The default es-
       cape is ^].

CAVEATS
       This program was written by the author as an exercise to show that com-
       municating  with  disconnected  processes is easy.  There are many fea-
       tures that could be added, but that is not the intent of this program.

NAME
       autoexpect - generate an Expect script from watching a session

SYNOPSIS
       autoexpect [ args ] [ program args...  ]

INTRODUCTION
       autoexpect  watches you interacting with another program and creates an
       Expect script that  reproduces  your  interactions.   For  straightline
       scripts,  autoexpect  saves  substantial  time  over writing scripts by
       hand.  Even if you are an Expect expert, you will find it convenient to
       use autoexpect to automate the more mindless parts of interactions.  It
       is much easier to cut/paste hunks of autoexpect scripts  together  than
       to write them from scratch.  And if you are a beginner, you may be able
       to get away with learning nothing more about Expect than  how  to  call
       autoexpect.

       The  simplest way to use autoexpect is to call it from the command line
       with no arguments.  For example:

            % autoexpect

       By default, autoexpect spawns a shell for you.  Given  a  program  name
       and arguments, autoexpect spawns that program.  For example:

            % autoexpect ftp ftp.cme.nist.gov

       Once your spawned program is running, interact normally.  When you have
       exited the shell (or program that you specified), autoexpect will  cre-
       ate a new script for you.  By default, autoexpect writes the new script
       to &quot;script.exp&quot;.  You can override this with the -f flag followed by  a
       new script name.

       The  following  example  runs &quot;ftp ftp.cme.nist.gov&quot; and stores the re-
       sulting Expect script in the file &quot;nist&quot;.

            % autoexpect -f nist ftp ftp.cme.nist.gov

       It is important to understand that  autoexpect  does  not  guarantee  a
       working script because it necessarily has to guess about certain things
       - and occasionally it guesses wrong.  However, it is usually very  easy
       to identify and fix these problems.  The typical problems are:

              o   Timing.   A  surprisingly large number of programs (rn, ksh,
                  zsh, telnet, etc.) and devices (e.g.,  modems)  ignore  key-
                  strokes  that  arrive  &quot;too  quickly&quot; after prompts.  If you
                  find your new script hanging up at one spot,  try  adding  a
                  short sleep just before the previous send.

                  You  can  force  this  behavior throughout by overriding the
                  variable &quot;force_conservative&quot; near the beginning of the gen-
                  erated  script.   This  &quot;conservative&quot; mode makes autoexpect
                  automatically pause briefly (one tenth of a  second)  before
                  sending  each character.  This pacifies every program I know
                  of.

                  This conservative mode is useful if you just want to quickly
                  reassure  yourself  that  the problem is a timing one (or if
                  you really don't care about how fast the script runs).  This
                  same  mode  can  be forced before script generation by using
                  the -c flag.

                  Fortunately, these timing spots are rare.  For example, tel-
                  net  ignores  characters  only after entering its escape se-
                  quence.  Modems only  ignore  characters  immediately  after
                  connecting  to  them for the first time.  A few programs ex-
                  hibit this behavior all the time but typically have a switch
                  to  disable it.  For example, rn's -T flag disables this be-
                  havior.

                  The following  example  starts  autoexpect  in  conservative
                  mode.

                       autoexpect -c

                  The  -C flag defines a key to toggle conservative mode.  The
                  following example  starts  autoexpect  (in  non-conservative
                  mode)  with  ^L as the toggle.  (Note that the ^L is entered
                  literally - i.e., enter a real control-L).

                       autoexpect -C ^L

                  The following example starts autoexpect in conservative mode
                  with ^L as the toggle.

                       autoexpect -c -C ^L

              o   Echoing.  Many program echo characters.  For example, if you
                  type &quot;more&quot; to a shell, what autoexpect actually sees is:

                       you typed 'm',
                       computer typed 'm',
                       you typed 'o',
                       computer typed 'o',
                       you typed 'r',
                       computer typed 'r',
                       ...

                  Without specific knowledge of the program, it is  impossible
                  to  know if you are waiting to see each character echoed be-
                  fore typing the next.  If autoexpect sees  characters  being
                  echoed,  it  assumes  that  it  can send them all as a group
                  rather than interleaving them the way  they  originally  ap-
                  peared.   This makes the script more pleasant to read.  How-
                  ever, it could conceivably be incorrect if you really had to
                  wait to see each character echoed.

              o   Change.   Autoexpect records every character from the inter-
                  action in the script.  This is desirable  because  it  gives
                  you  the  ability to make judgements about what is important
                  and what can be replaced with a pattern match.

                  On the other hand, if you use commands whose output  differs
                  from  run  to run, the generated scripts are not going to be
                  correct.  For example, the &quot;date&quot;  command  always  produces
                  different  output.   So using the date command while running
                  autoexpect is a sure way to produce a script that  will  re-
                  quire editing in order for it to work.

                  The  -p  flag  puts  autoexpect into &quot;prompt mode&quot;.  In this
                  mode, autoexpect will only look for the  the  last  line  of
                  program  output - which is usually the prompt.  This handles
                  the date problem (see above) and most others.

                  The following example starts autoexpect in prompt mode.

                       autoexpect -p

                  The -P flag defines a key to toggle prompt mode.   The  fol-
                  lowing  example  starts autoexpect (in non-prompt mode) with
                  ^P as the toggle.  Note that the ^P is entered  literally  -
                  i.e., enter a real control-P.

                       autoexpect -P ^P

                  The  following example starts autoexpect in prompt mode with
                  ^P as the toggle.

                       autoexpect -p -P ^P

OTHER FLAGS
       The -quiet flag disables informational messages produced by autoexpect.

       The -Q flag names a quote character which can be used to enter  charac-
       ters  that  autoexpect would otherwise consume because they are used as
       toggles.

       The following example shows a number of flags with quote used  to  pro-
       vide a way of entering the toggles literally.

            autoexpect -P ^P -C ^L -Q ^Q

STYLE
       I  don't  know if there is a &quot;style&quot; for Expect programs but autoexpect
       should definitely not be held up as any model of style.   For  example,
       autoexpect  uses  features of Expect that are intended specifically for
       computer-generated scripting.  So don't try to faithfully write scripts
       that  appear as if they were generated by autoexpect.  This is not use-
       ful.

       On the other hand, autoexpect scripts do show some  worthwhile  things.
       For  example, you can see how any string must be quoted in order to use
       it in a Tcl script simply by running the strings through autoexpect.

       tures that could be added, but that is not the intent of this program.

KIBITZ(1)                   General Commands Manual                  KIBITZ(1)

NAME
       kibitz - allow two people to interact with one shell

SYNOPSIS
       kibitz [ kibitz-args ] user [ program program-args...  ]
       kibitz [ kibitz-args ] user@host [ program program-args...  ]

INTRODUCTION
       kibitz  allows  two (or more) people to interact with one shell (or any
       arbitrary program).  Uses include:

              o   A novice user can ask an expert user for help.   Using  kib-
                  itz,  the  expert  can see what the user is doing, and offer
                  advice or show how to do it right.

              o   By running kibitz and then starting  a  full-screen  editor,
                  people  may  carry out a conversation, retaining the ability
                  to scroll backwards, save the entire conversation,  or  even
                  edit it while in progress.

              o   People  can team up on games, document editing, or other co-
                  operative tasks where each person has  strengths  and  weak-
                  nesses that complement one another.

USAGE
       To  start  kibitz,  user1  runs kibitz with the argument of the user to
       kibitz.  For example:

            kibitz user2

       kibitz starts a new shell (or another program, if given on the  command
       line),  while  prompting  user2 to run kibitz.  If user2 runs kibitz as
       directed, the keystrokes of both users become the input of  the  shell.
       Similarly, both users receive the output from the shell.

       To terminate kibitz it suffices to terminate the shell itself.  For ex-
       ample, if either user types ^D (and the shell accepts this to be  EOF),
       the shell terminates followed by kibitz.

       Normally, all characters are passed uninterpreted.  However, if the es-
       cape character (described when kibitz starts) is issued, the  user  may
       talk  directly to the kibitz interpreter.  Any Expect(1) or Tcl(3) com-
       mands may be given.  Also, job control may be used while in the  inter-
       preter, to, for example, suspend or restart kibitz.

       Various  processes  can  provide various effects.  For example, you can
       emulate a two-way write(1) session with the command:

            kibitz user2 sleep 1000000

ARGUMENTS
       kibitz takes arguments, these should also be separated by whitespace.

       The -noproc flag runs kibitz with no  process  underneath.   Characters
       are  passed  to the other kibitz.  This is particularly useful for con-
       necting multiple interactive processes together.  In this mode, charac-
       ters are not echoed back to the typist.

       -noescape disables the escape character.

       -escape  char  sets the escape character.  The default escape character
       is ^].

       -silent turns off informational messages describing what kibitz is  do-
       ing to initiate a connection.

       -tty ttyname defines the tty to which the invitation should be sent.

       If  you  start  kibitz to user2 on a remote computer, kibitz performs a
       rlogin to the remote computer with  your  current  username.  The  flag
       -proxy  username  causes  rlogin  to  use username for the remote login
       (e.g. if your account on the remote computer has a different username).
       If the -proxy flag is not given, kibitz tries to determine your current
       username by (in that order) inspecting the environment  variables  USER
       and LOGNAME, then by using the commands whoami and logname.

       The  arguments  -noescape  and  -escape can also be given by user2 when
       prompted to run kibitz.

MORE THAN TWO USERS
       The current implementation of kibitz explicitly  understands  only  two
       users,  however,  it  is nonetheless possible to have a three (or more)
       -way kibitz, by kibitzing another kibitz.  For example,  the  following
       command runs kibitz with the current user, user2, and user3:

            % kibitz user2 kibitz user3

       Additional  users  may  be added by simply appending more &quot;kibitz user&quot;
       commands.

       The xkibitz script is similar to kibitz but supports the ability to add
       additional users (and drop them) dynamically.

CAVEATS
       kibitz  assumes the 2nd user has the same terminal type and size as the
       1st user.  If this assumption is incorrect, graphical programs may dis-
       play oddly.

       kibitz  handles  character graphics, but cannot handle bitmapped graph-
       ics.  Thus,

            % xterm -e kibitz    will work
            % kibitz xterm       will not work

       However, you can get the effect of the latter command by using  xkibitz
       (see  SEE  ALSO  below).   kibitz  uses the same permissions as used by
       rlogin, rsh, etc.  Thus, you can only kibitz  to  users  at  hosts  for
       which  you can rlogin.  Similarly, kibitz will prompt for a password on
       the remote host if rlogin would.

       If you kibitz to users at remote hosts,  kibitz  needs  to  distinguish
       your  prompt from other things that may precede it during login.  (Ide-
       ally, the end of it is preferred but any part should suffice.)  If  you
       have  an  unusual prompt, set the environment variable EXPECT_PROMPT to
       an egrep(1)-style regular expression.  Brackets should be preceded with
       one  backslash  in  ranges, and three backslashes for literal brackets.
       The default prompt r.e. is &quot;($|%|#) &quot;.

       kibitz requires the kibitz program on both hosts.  kibitz requires  ex-
       pect(1).

       By  comparison,  the  xkibitz script uses the X authorization mechanism
       for inter-host communication so it does not need  to  login,  recognize
       your  prompt,  or  require  kibitz on the remote host.  It does however
       need permission to access the other X servers.

BUGS
       An early version of Sun's tmpfs had a bug in it that causes  kibitz  to
       blow  up.   If  kibitz reports &quot;error flushing ...: Is a directory&quot; ask
       Sun for patch #100174.

       If your Expect is not compiled with multiple-process support (i.e., you
       do not have a working select or poll), you will not be able to run kib-
       itz.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variable SHELL is used to determine the shell to start,
       if no other program is given on the command line.

       If the environment variable EXPECT_PROMPT exists, it is taken as a reg-
       ular expression which matches the end of your login  prompt  (but  does
       not otherwise occur while logging in). See also CAVEATS above.

       If the environment variables USER or LOGNAME are defined, they are used
       to determine the current user name for a kibitz to a  remote  computer.
       See description of the -proxy option in ARGUMENTS above.

MULTIXTERM(1)               General Commands Manual              MULTIXTERM(1)

NAME
       multixterm - drive multiple xterms separately or together

SYNOPSIS
       multixterm [ args ]

DESCRIPTION
       Multixterm creates multiple xterms that can be driven together or sepa-
       rately.

       In its simplest form, multixterm is run with no arguments and  commands
       are  interactively  entered in the first entry field.  Press return (or
       click the &quot;new xterm&quot; button) to create a new xterm running  that  com-
       mand.

       Keystrokes  in  the &quot;stdin window&quot; are redirected to all xterms started
       by multixterm.  xterms may be driven separately simply by  focusing  on
       them.

       The  stdin  window must have the focus for keystrokes to be sent to the
       xterms.  When it has the focus, the color changes  to  aquamarine.   As
       characters  are entered, the color changes to green for a second.  This
       provides feedback since characters are not echoed in the stdin window.

       Typing in the stdin window while holding down  the  alt  or  meta  keys
       sends  an  escape character before the typed characters.  This provides
       support for programs such as emacs.

ARGUMENTS
              -xa The optional -xa argument indicates  arguments  to  pass  to
                  xterm.

              -xc The  optional  -xc argument indicates a command to be run in
                  each named xterm (see -xn).  With no -xc argument, the  com-
                  mand is the current shell.

              -xd The  optional  -xd  argument indicates a directory to search
                  for files that will appear in the Files menu.   By  default,
                  the directory is: ~/lib/multixterm

              -xf The  optional  -xf  argument  indicates a file to be read at
                  startup.  See FILES below for more info.

              -xn The optional -xn argument indicates a name for  each  xterm.
                  This name will also be substituted for any %n in the command
                  argument (see -xc).

              -xv The optional -xv flag puts multixterm into  a  verbose  mode
                  where it will describe some of the things it is doing inter-
                  nally.  The verbose output is not intended to be understand-
                  able to anyone but the author.

       Less  common  options may be changed by the startup file (see FILES be-
       low).

       All the usual X and wish flags are supported (i.e.,  -display,  -name).
       There are so many of them that to avoid colliding and make them easy to
       remember, all the multixterm flags begin with -x.

       If any arguments do not match the flags above,  the  remainder  of  the
       command  line  is  made available for user processing.  By default, the
       remainder is used as a list of xterm names in the style  of  -xn.   The
       default  behavior  may be changed using the .multixtermrc file (see DOT
       FILE below).

EXAMPLE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
       The following command line starts up two xterms using ssh to the  hosts
       bud and dexter.

            multixterm -xc &quot;ssh %n&quot; bud dexter

FILES
       Command  files may be used to drive or initialize multixterm.  The File
       menu may be used to invoke other files.  If files exist in the  command
       file  directory  (see  -xd  above),  they will appear in the File menu.
       Files may also be loaded by using File-&gt;Open.  Any filename is  accept-
       able but the File-&gt;Open browser defaults to files with a .mxt suffix.

       Files  are  written  in  Tcl and may change any variables or invoke any
       procedures.  The primary variables of  interest  are  'xtermCmd'  which
       identifies  the  command  (see -xc) and 'xtermNames' which is a list of
       names (see -xn).  The procedure xtermStartAll, starts xterms  for  each
       name  in the list.  Other variables and procedures may be discovered by
       examining multixterm itself.

EXAMPLE FILE
       The following file does the same thing as the earlier  example  command
       line:

            # start two xterms connected to bud and dexter
            set xtermCmd &quot;ssh %n&quot;
            set xtermNames {bud dexter}
            xtermStartAll

DOT FILE
       At startup, multixterm reads ~/.multixtermrc if present.  This is simi-
       lar to the command files (see FILES above)  except  that  .multixtermrc
       may  not  call xtermStartAll.  Instead it is called implicitly, similar
       to the way that it is implicit in the command line use of -xn.

       The following example .multixtermrc file makes every xterm run  ssh  to
       the hosts named on the command line.

            set xtermCmd &quot;ssh %n&quot;

       Then multixterm could be called simply:

            multixterm bud dexter

       If  any command-line argument does not match a multixterm flag, the re-
       mainder of the command line is made available to .multixtermrc  in  the
       argv  variable.  If argv is non-empty when .multixtermrc returns, it is
       assigned to xtermNames unless xtermNames is non-empty  in  which  case,
       the content of argv is ignored.

       Commands  from  multixterm are evaluated early in the initialization of
       multixterm.  Anything that must be  done  late  in  the  initialization
       (such  as adding additional bindings to the user interface) may be done
       by putting the commands inside a procedure called &quot;initLate&quot;.

MENUS
       Except as otherwise noted, the menus are self-explanatory.  Some of the
       menus  have  dashed  lines  as the first entry.  Clicking on the dashed
       lines will &quot;tear off&quot; the menus.

USAGE SUGGESTION - ALIASES AND COMMAND FILES
       Aliases may be used to store lengthy command-line invocations.  Command
       files  can be also be used to store such invocations as well as provid-
       ing a convenient way to share configurations.

       Tcl is a general-purpose language.  Thus multixterm command  files  can
       be extremely flexible, such as loading hostnames from other programs or
       files that may change from day-to-day.  In addition, command files  can
       be  used for other purposes.  For example, command files may be used to
       prepared common canned interaction sequences.  For example, the command
       to send the same string to all xterms is:

           xtermSend &quot;a particularly long string&quot;

       The  File  menu  (torn-off)  makes canned sequences particularly conve-
       nient.  Interactions could also be bound to a mouse button,  keystroke,
       or added to a menu via the .multixtermrc file.

       The  following .multixtermrc causes tiny xterms to tile across and down
       the screen.  (You may have to adjust the parameters for  your  screen.)
       This can be very helpful when dealing with large numbers of xterms.

           set yPos 0
           set xPos 0

           trace variable xtermArgs r traceArgs

           proc traceArgs {args} {
               global xPos yPos
               set ::xtermArgs &quot;-geometry 80x12+$xPos+$yPos -font 6x10&quot;
               if {$xPos} {
                   set xPos 0
                   incr yPos 145
                   if {$yPos &gt; 800} {set yPos 0}
               } else {
                   set xPos 500
               }
           }

       The  xtermArgs variable in the code above is the variable corresponding
       to the -xa argument.

       xterms can be also be created directly.   The  following  command  file
       creates three xterms overlapped horizontally:

           set xPos 0
           foreach name {bud dexter hotdog} {
               set ::xtermArgs &quot;-geometry 80x12+$xPos+0 -font 6x10&quot;
               set ::xtermNames $name
               xtermStartAll
               incr xPos 300
           }

USAGE SUGGESTION - SELECTING HOSTS BY NICKNAME
       The  following  .multixtermrc  shows an example of changing the default
       handling of the arguments from hostnames to a filename containing host-
       names:

            set xtermNames [exec cat $argv]

       The  following  is  a  variation, retrieving the host names from the yp
       database:

            set xtermNames [exec ypcat $argv]

       The following hardcodes two sets of hosts, so that you can call multix-
       term with either &quot;cluster1&quot; or &quot;cluster2&quot;:

            switch $argv {
                   cluster1 {
                       set xtermNames &quot;bud dexter&quot;
                   }
                   cluster2 {
                       set xtermNames &quot;frank hotdog weiner&quot;
                   }
               }

COMPARE/CONTRAST
       It  is  worth  comparing  multixterm to xkibitz.  Multixterm connects a
       separate process to each xterm.  xkibitz connects the same  process  to
       each xterm.

LIMITATIONS
       Multixterm  provides no way to remotely control scrollbars, resize, and
       most other window system related functions.

       Because xterm has no mechanism for propagating size information to  ex-
       ternal  processes,  particularly  for  character  graphic  applications
       (e.g., vi, emacs), you may have to manually  ensure  that  the  spawned
       process  behind  each  xterm has the correct size.  For example, if you
       create or set the xterm to a size, you may have  to  send  an  explicit
       stty  command with the correct size to the spawned process(es).  Alter-
       natively, you can add the correct size argument when an xterm  is  cre-
       ated (i.e., &quot;-geometry 80x20&quot;).

       Multixterm  can  only  control  new  xterms  that multixterm itself has
       started.

       As a convenience, the File menu shows a limited number  of  files.   To
       show all the files, use File-&gt;Open.

FILES
       $DOTDIR/.multixtermrc   initial command file
       ~/.multixtermrc         fallback command file
       ~/lib/multixterm/       default command file directory

BUGS
       If  multixterm  is killed using an uncatchable kill, the xterms are not
       killed.  This appears to be a bug in xterm itself.

       Send/expect sequences can be done in multixterm  command  files.   How-
       ever, due to the richness of the possibilities, to document it properly
       would take more time than the author has at present.

REQUIREMENTS
       Requires Expect 5.36.0 or later.
       Requires Tk 8.3.3 or later.

VERSION
       This man page describes version 1.8 of multixterm.

PASSMASS(1)                 General Commands Manual                PASSMASS(1)

NAME
       passmass - change password on multiple machines

SYNOPSIS
       passmass [ host1 host2 host3 ...  ]

INTRODUCTION
       Passmass changes a password on multiple machines.  If you have accounts
       on several machines that do not share password databases, Passmass  can
       help  you keep them all in sync.  This, in turn, will make it easier to
       change them more frequently.

       When Passmass runs, it asks you for the old and new passwords.  (If you
       are changing root passwords and have equivalencing, the old password is
       not used and may be omitted.)

       Passmass understands the &quot;usual&quot; conventions.  Additional arguments may
       be  used  for tuning.  They affect all hosts which follow until another
       argument overrides it.  For example, if you are  known  as  &quot;libes&quot;  on
       host1 and host2, but &quot;don&quot; on host3, you would say:

            passmass host1 host2 -user don host3

       Arguments are:

              -user
                  User  whose  password will be changed.  By default, the cur-
                  rent user is used.

              -rlogin
                  Use rlogin to access host.  (default)

              -slogin
                  Use slogin to access host.

              -ssh
                  Use ssh to access host.

              -telnet
                  Use telnet to access host.

              -program

                  Next argument is a program to run to set the password.   De-
                  fault  is &quot;passwd&quot;.  Other common choices are &quot;yppasswd&quot; and
                  &quot;set passwd&quot; (e.g., VMS hosts).   A  program  name  such  as
                  &quot;password  fred&quot;  can  be used to create entries for new ac-
                  counts (when run as root).

              -prompt
                  Next argument is a prompt suffix pattern.  This  allows  the
                  script  to know when the shell is prompting.  The default is
                  &quot;# &quot; for root and &quot;% &quot; for non-root accounts.

              -timeout
                  Next argument is the number  of  seconds  to  wait  for  re-
                  sponses.   Default is 30 but some systems can be much slower
                  logging in.

              -su

                  Next argument is  1  or  0.   If  1,  you  are  additionally
                  prompted  for a root password which is used to su after log-
                  ging in.  root's password is changed rather than the user's.
                  This is useful for hosts which do not allow root to log in.

HOW TO USE
       The  best way to run Passmass is to put the command in a one-line shell
       script or alias.  Whenever you get a new account on a new machine,  add
       the  appropriate  arguments  to  the command.  Then run it whenever you
       want to change your passwords on all the hosts.

CAVEATS
       Using the same password on multiple hosts carries risks.   In  particu-
       lar,  if  the  password can be stolen, then all of your accounts are at
       risk.  Thus, you should not use Passmass in situations where your pass-
       word  is  visible,  such as across a network which hackers are known to
       eavesdrop.

       On the other hand, if you have enough  accounts  with  different  pass-
       words,  you  may end up writing them down somewhere - and that can be a
       security problem.  Funny story: my  college  roommate  had  an  11&quot;x13&quot;
       piece of paper on which he had listed accounts and passwords all across
       the Internet.  This was several years worth of careful work and he car-
       ried it with him everywhere he went.  Well one day, he forgot to remove
       it from his jeans, and we found a perfectly blank sheet of  paper  when
       we took out the wash the following day!

TKNEWSBIFF(1)               General Commands Manual              TKNEWSBIFF(1)

NAME
       tknewsbiff - pop up a window when news appears

SYNOPSIS
       tknewsbiff [ server or config-file ]

INTRODUCTION
       tknewsbiff  pops up a window when there is unread news in your favorite
       newsgroups and removes the window after you've read the news.  tknewsb-
       iff can optionally play a sound, start your newsreader, etc.

SELECTING NEWSGROUPS
       By default, the configuration file ~/.tknewsbiff describes how tknewsb-
       iff behaves.  The syntax observes the usual Tcl rules -  however,  even
       if you don't know Tcl, all but the most esoteric configurations will be
       obvious.

       Each newsgroup (or set of newsgroups) to be watched is described by us-
       ing the &quot;watch&quot; command.  For example:

       watch dc.dining
       watch nist.*
       watch comp.unix.wizard  -threshold 3
       watch *.sources.*       -threshold 20

       For each newsgroup pattern, any newsgroup that matches it and which you
       are subscribed to (according to your newsrc file) is eligible  for  re-
       porting.   By  default, tknewsbiff reports on the newsgroup if there is
       at least one unread article.  The &quot;-threshold&quot; flag changes the thresh-
       old  to  the following number.  For example, &quot;-threshold 3&quot; means there
       must be at least three articles unread before  tknewsbiff  will  report
       the newsgroup.

       If  no  watch commands are given (or no configuration file exists), all
       groups which are subscribed to are watched.

       To suppress newsgroups that would otherwise be reported, use  the  &quot;ig-
       nore&quot;  command.   For  example,  the  following  matches all comp.* and
       nist.* newgroups except for nist.posix or .d (discussion) groups:

       watch comp.*
       watch nist.*
       ignore nist.posix.*
       ignore *.d

       The flag &quot;-new&quot; describes a command to be executed when  the  newsgroup
       is  first  reported  as having unread news.  For example, the following
       lines invoke the UNIX command &quot;play&quot; to play a sound.

       watch dc.dining -new &quot;exec play /usr/local/sounds/yumyum.au&quot;
       watch rec.auto* -new &quot;exec play /usr/local/sounds/vroom.au&quot;

       You can cut down on the verbosity of actions  by  defining  procedures.
       For example, if you have many -new flags that all play sound files, you
       could define a sound procedure.  This would allow the  -new  specifica-
       tion to be much shorter.

       proc play {sound} {
            exec play /usr/local/sounds/$sound.au
       }

       watch dc.dining -new &quot;play yumyum&quot;
       watch rec.auto* -new &quot;play vroom&quot;

       As  an aside, you can put an &quot;&amp;&quot; at the end of an &quot;exec&quot; command to get
       commands to execute asynchronously.  However, it's probably not a  good
       idea to do this when playing sound files anyway.

       &quot;newsgroup&quot;  is  a  read-only  variable  which contains the name of the
       newsgroup that is being reported.  This is useful when  the  action  is
       triggered  by a pattern.  For example, the following line could run the
       newsgroup name through a speech synthesizer:

       watch * -new {
            exec play herald.au
            exec speak &quot;New news has arrived in $newsgroup.&quot;
       }

       The flag &quot;-display&quot; describes a command to be executed every  time  the
       newsgroup is reported as having unread news.  The special command &quot;dis-
       play&quot; is the default command.  It schedules $newsgroup to be written to
       tknewsbiff's  display when it is rewritten.  For example, by explicitly
       providing a -display flag that omits the display command, you can  dis-
       able the display of newsgroups that are already reported via -new.

       watch dc.dining -new {exec play yumyum.au} -display {}

       If you want to execute an action repeatedly and still display the news-
       group in the default manner, explicitly invoke the display command  via
       the -display flag.  For example:

       watch *security* -display {
            exec play red-alert.au
            display
       }

       Actions  associated  with the -new and -display flags are executed only
       once for each matching newsgroup.  The command executed is the one  as-
       sociated  with the first pattern in the configuration file that matches
       and observes the given threshold.

       Any command that is simply listed in the configuration file is executed
       each  time  before  the  update  loop in tknewsbiff.  The reserved (but
       user-defined) procedure &quot;user&quot; is run immediately after the  newsgroups
       are scheduled to be written to the display and before they are actually
       written.

       For example, suppose unread articles appear in several rec.auto  groups
       and you play the same sound for each one.  To prevent playing the sound
       several times in a row, make the -new command simply set  a  flag.   In
       the  user  procedure, play the sound if the flag is set (and then reset
       the flag).

       The user procedure could also be used  to  start  a  newsreader.   This
       would  avoid  the possibility of starting multiple newsreaders just be-
       cause multiple newsgroups contained unread articles.  (A check  should,
       of  course,  be made to make sure that a newsreader is not already run-
       ning.)

MORE VARIABLES
       The following example lines show variables that can affect the behavior
       of tknewsbiff

       set delay          120
       set server         news.nist.gov
       set server_timeout 60
       set newsrc         ~/.newsrc
       set width          40
       set height         20
       set active_file    /usr/news/lib/active

       tknewsbiff  alternates  between  checking  for unread news and sleeping
       (kind of like many undergraduates).  The &quot;delay&quot; variable describes how
       many seconds to sleep.

       The  &quot;server&quot;  variable  names  an  NNTP  news-server.   The default is
       &quot;news&quot;.  The &quot;server&quot; variable is only used if the &quot;active_file&quot;  vari-
       able is not set.

       The  &quot;server_timeout&quot;  variable  describes how how many seconds to wait
       for a response from the server before giving up.  -1 means wait forever
       or until the server itself times out.  The default is 60 seconds.

       The  &quot;newsrc&quot; variable describes the name of your .newsrc file.  By de-
       fault, tknewsbiff looks in your home directory for a  newsrc  file.   A
       server-specific  newsrc is used if found.  For example, if you have set
       server to &quot;cubit.nist.gov&quot;, then  tknewsbiff  looks  for  ~/.newsrc-cu-
       bit.nist.gov.   (This is the Emacs gnus convention - which is very con-
       venient when you read news from multiple  servers.)   If  there  is  no
       server-specific newsrc, tknewsbiff uses ~/.newsrc.

       The  &quot;width&quot;  variable  describes the width that tknewsbiff will use to
       display information.  If any newsgroup names are long enough, they will
       be  truncated  so  that the article counts can still be shown.  You can
       manually resize the window to see what was truncated.  However, if your
       configuration file sets the width variable, the window will be restored
       to that size the next time that tknewsbiff checks for unread  news  and
       updates its display.

       The &quot;height&quot; variable describes the maximum height that tknewsbiff will
       use to display information.  If fewer newsgroups are reported, tknewsb-
       iff  will shrink the window appropriately.  You can manually resize the
       window but if your configuration file sets  the  height  variable,  the
       window  will  be  restored  to  that size the next time that tknewsbiff
       checks for unread news and updates its display.

       The &quot;active_file&quot; variable describes the name of the news active  file.
       If  set,  the  active file is read directly in preference to using NNTP
       (even if the &quot;server&quot; variable is set).  This  is  particularly  useful
       for  testing  out new configuration files since you can edit a fake ac-
       tive file and then click button 2 to immediately see how tknewsbiff re-
       sponds (see BUTTONS below).

       If  the environment variable DOTDIR is set, then its value is used as a
       directory in which to find all dotfiles instead of from the home direc-
       tory.   In  particular,  this affects the tknewsbiff configuration file
       and the .newsrc file (assuming the newsrc variable is not  set  explic-
       itly).

WATCHING DIFFERENT NEWS SERVERS
       To  watch  multiple servers, run tknewsbiff multiple times.  (Since you
       need different .newsrc files and the servers have different  newsgroups
       and article numbers anyway, there is no point in trying to do this in a
       single process.)

       You can point tknewsbiff at a different server with an appropriate  ar-
       gument.  The argument is tried both as a configuration file name and as
       a suffix to the string &quot;~/.tknewsbiff-&quot;.  So if you want to  watch  the
       server  &quot;kidney&quot;,  store  the  tknewsbiff  configuration information in
       ~/.tknewsbiff-kidney&quot;.  The following two commands will both  use  that
       configuration file.

            tknewsbiff kidney
            tknewsbiff ~/.tknewsbiff-kidney

       In  both cases, the actual server to contact is set by the value of the
       server variable in the configuration file.

       If no configuration file is found, the argument is used as  the  server
       to contact.  This allows tknewsbiff to be run with no preparation what-
       soever.

       If the argument is the special keyword &quot;active&quot; (or ends in &quot;/active&quot;),
       it is used as the name of an active file.  This is in turn used to ini-
       tialize the variable &quot;active_file&quot; so that tknewsbiff  reads  from  the
       active file directly rather than using NNTP.

       Creating  your own active file is a convenient way of testing your con-
       figuration file.  For example, after running the following command, you
       can repeatedly edit your active file and trigger the update-now command
       (either by pressing button 2 or setting the delay variable very low) to
       see how tknewsbiff responds.

       The active file must follow the format of a real active file.  The for-
       mat is one newsgroup per line.  After the newsgroup name is the  number
       of  the highest article, the lowest article.  Lastly is the letter y or
       m.  m means the newsgroup is moderated.  y means posting is allowed.

WINDOW
       When unread news is found, a window is popped up.  The window lists the
       names  of the newsgroups and the number of unread articles in each (un-
       less suppressed by the -display flag).  When there is no longer any un-
       read  news,  the  window  disappears (although the process continues to
       run).

BUTTONS
       Button or key bindings may be assigned by bind commands.  Feel free  to
       change them.  The default bind commands are:

       bind .list &lt;1&gt; help
       bind .list &lt;2&gt; update-now
       bind .list &lt;3&gt; unmapwindow

       By default button 1 (left) is bound to &quot;help&quot;.  The help command causes
       tknewsbiff to pop up a help window.

       By default, button 2 (middle) is bound to &quot;update-now&quot;.  The update-now
       command  causes  tknewsbiff  to  immediately check for unread news.  If
       your news server is slow or maintains a  very  large  number  of  news-
       groups,  or  you  have a large number of patterns in your configuration
       file, tknewsbiff can take considerable time  before  actually  updating
       the window.

       By  default, button 3 (right) is bound to &quot;unmapwindow&quot;.  The unmapwin-
       dow command causes tknewsbiff to remove the window from the display un-
       til  the next time it finds unread news.  (The mapwindow command causes
       tknewsbiff to restore the window.)

       As an example, here is a binding to pop up an xterm and run rn when you
       hold down the shift key and press button 1 in the listing window.

       bind .list &lt;Shift-1&gt; {
            exec xterm -e rn &amp;
       }

       Here  is  a  similar  binding.  However it tells rn to look only at the
       newsgroup that is under the mouse when  you  pressed  it.   (The  &quot;dis-
       play_list&quot; variable is described later in this man page.)

       bind .list &lt;Shift-1&gt; {
            exec xterm -e rn [lindex $display_list [.list nearest %y]] &amp;
       }

OTHER COMMANDS AND VARIABLES
       Built-in  commands already mentioned are: watch, ignore, display, help,
       update-now, unmapwindow, and mapwindow.

       Any Tcl and Tk command can also be given.  In particular, the  list  of
       newsgroups  is stored in the list widget &quot;.list&quot;, and the scroll bar is
       stored in the scrollbar widget &quot;.scroll&quot;.  So for example, if you  want
       to  change  the foreground and background colors of the newsgroup list,
       you can say:

            .list config -bg honeydew1 -fg orchid2

       These can also be controlled by the X resource database as well.   How-
       ever,  the configuration file allows arbitrarily complex commands to be
       evaluated rather than simple assignments.

       Certain Tcl/Tk commands can  disrupt  proper  function  of  tknewsbiff.
       These will probably be obvious to anyone who knows enough to give these
       commands in the first place.  As a simple example, the program  assumes
       the font in the list box is of fixed width.  The newsgroups will likely
       not align if you use a variable-width font.

       The following variables are accessible and can  be  used  for  esoteric
       uses.  All other variables are private.  Private variables and commands
       begin with &quot;_&quot; so you don't need to worry about accidental collisions.

       The array &quot;db&quot; is a database which maintains information about read and
       unread  news.   db($newsgroup,hi)  is  the highest article that exists.
       db($newsgroup,seen) is the highest article that you have read.

       A number of lists maintain interesting information. &quot;active_list&quot; is  a
       list  of  known  newsgroups.   &quot;seen_list&quot; is a list of newsgroups that
       have been seen so far as the -new and -display  flags  are  being  pro-
       cessed.   &quot;previous_seen_list&quot;  is &quot;seen_list&quot; from the previous cycle.
       &quot;ignore_list&quot;  is  the  list   of   newsgroup   patterns   to   ignore.
       &quot;watch_list&quot;  is  the  list  of  newsgroup  patterns  to  watch.  &quot;dis-
       play_list&quot; is the list of newsgroup will be displayed at the  next  op-
       portunity.

UPDATING YOUR FILES
       tknewsbiff  automatically  rereads your configuration file each time it
       wakes up to check for unread news.  To force tknewsbiff to  reread  the
       file  immediately  (such  as  if you are testing a new configuration or
       have just modified your newsrc file), press button  2  in  the  display
       (see BUTTONS above).

CAVEATS
       tknewsbiff  defines the number of unread articles as the highest exist-
       ing article minus the highest article that you've read.  So  if  you've
       read the last article in the newsgroup but no others, tknewsbiff thinks
       there are no unread articles.  (It's impossible to  do  any  better  by
       reading  the active file and it would be very time consuming to do this
       more accurately via NNTP since servers provide no efficient way of  re-
       porting  their own holes in the newsgroups.)  Fortunately, this defini-
       tion is considered a feature by most people.  It allows you to read ar-
       ticles  and  then  mark  them &quot;unread&quot; but not have tknewsbiff continue
       telling you that they are unread.

UNWARRANTED CONCERNS
       Your news administrator may wonder if many people using tknewsbiff  se-
       verely  impact  an NNTP server.  In fact, the impact is negligible even
       when the delay is very low.  To gather all the  information  it  needs,
       tknewsbiff uses a single NNTP query - it just asks for the active file.
       The NNTP server does no computation, formatting, etc, it just sends the
       file.  All the interesting processing happens locally in the tknewsbiff
       program itself.

UNBUFFER(1)                 General Commands Manual                UNBUFFER(1)

NAME
       unbuffer - unbuffer output

SYNOPSIS
       unbuffer program [ args ]

INTRODUCTION
       unbuffer  disables the output buffering that occurs when program output
       is redirected from non-interactive programs.  For example, suppose  you
       are  watching  the output from a fifo by running it through od and then
       more.

            od -c /tmp/fifo | more

       You will not see anything until a full page of  output  has  been  pro-
       duced.

       You can disable this automatic buffering as follows:

            unbuffer od -c /tmp/fifo | more

       Normally,  unbuffer  does  not read from stdin.  This simplifies use of
       unbuffer in some situations.  To use unbuffer in a pipeline, use the -p
       flag.  Example:

               process1 | unbuffer -p process2 | process3

CAVEATS
       unbuffer  -p  may appear to work incorrectly if a process feeding input
       to unbuffer exits.  Consider:
               process1 | unbuffer -p process2 | process3

       If process1 exits, process2 may not yet have finished.  It is  impossi-
       ble for unbuffer to know long to wait for process2 and process2 may not
       ever finish, for example, if it is a filter.  For expediency,  unbuffer
       simply  exits  when  it  encounters  an  EOF  from  either its input or
       process2.

       In order to have a version of unbuffer that worked in  all  situations,
       an  oracle would be necessary.  If you want an application-specific so-
       lution, workarounds or hand-coded Expect may be more suitable.  For ex-
       ample, the following example shows how to allow grep to finish process-
       ing when the cat before it finishes first.   Using  cat  to  feed  grep
       would  never require unbuffer in real life.  It is merely a placeholder
       for some imaginary process that may or may not finish.  Similarly,  the
       final  cat at the end of the pipeline is also a placeholder for another
       process.

       $ cat /tmp/abcdef.log | grep abc | cat
       abcdef
       xxxabc defxxx
       $ cat /tmp/abcdef.log | unbuffer grep abc | cat
       $ (cat /tmp/abcdef.log ; sleep 1) | unbuffer grep abc | cat
       abcdef
       xxxabc defxxx
       $

       The man page is longer than the program.

XKIBITZ(1)                  General Commands Manual                 XKIBITZ(1)

NAME
       xkibitz - allow multiple people to interact in an xterm

SYNOPSIS
       xkibitz [ xkibitz-args ] [ program program-args...  ]

INTRODUCTION
       xkibitz allows users in separate xterms to share one shell (or any pro-
       gram that runs in an xterm).  Uses include:

              o   A novice user can ask an expert user for help.  Using  xkib-
                  itz,  the  expert  can see what the user is doing, and offer
                  advice or show how to do it right.

              o   By running xkibitz and then starting a  full-screen  editor,
                  people  may  carry out a conversation, retaining the ability
                  to scroll backwards, save the entire conversation,  or  even
                  edit it while in progress.

              o   People  can team up on games, document editing, or other co-
                  operative tasks where each person has  strengths  and  weak-
                  nesses that complement one another.

              o   If  you  want to have a large number of people do an on-line
                  code walk-through, you can sit two in front of each worksta-
                  tion,  and then connect them all together while you everyone
                  looks at code together in the editor.

USAGE
       To start xkibitz, one user (the master) runs xkibitz with no arguments.

       xkibitz starts a new shell (or another program, if given on the command
       line).  The user can interact normally with the shell, or upon entering
       an escape (described when xkibitz starts) can add users to the interac-
       tion.

       To  add  users,  enter &quot;+ display&quot; where display is the X display name.
       If there is no &quot;:X.Y&quot; in the display name, &quot;:0.0&quot; is assumed.  The mas-
       ter  user must have permission to access each display.  Each display is
       assigned a tag - a small integer which can be  used  to  reference  the
       display.

       To show the current tags and displays, enter &quot;=&quot;.

       To drop a display, enter &quot;- tag&quot; where tag is the display's tag accord-
       ing to the &quot;=&quot; command.

       To return to the shared shell, enter &quot;return&quot;.  Then the keystrokes  of
       all  users become the input of the shell.  Similarly, all users receive
       the output from the shell.

       To terminate xkibitz it suffices to terminate the  shell  itself.   For
       example,  if  any user types ^D (and the shell accepts this to be EOF),
       the shell terminates followed by xkibitz.

       Normally, all characters are passed uninterpreted.  However, in the es-
       cape  dialogue the user talks directly to the xkibitz interpreter.  Any
       Expect(1) or Tcl(3) commands may also be given.  Also, job control  may
       be  used  while in the interpreter, to, for example, suspend or restart
       xkibitz.

       Various processes can produce various effects.  For  example,  you  can
       emulate a multi-way write(1) session with the command:

            xkibitz sleep 1000000

ARGUMENTS
       xkibitz  understands a few special arguments which should appear before
       the program name (if given).  Each  argument  should  be  separated  by
       whitespace.   If the arguments themselves takes arguments, these should
       also be separated by whitespace.

       -escape sets the escape character.  The default escape character is ^].

       -display adds a display much like the &quot;+&quot; command.   Multiple  -display
       flags  can be given.  For example, to start up xkibitz with three addi-
       tional displays:

            xkibitz -display mercury -display fox -display dragon:1.0

CAVEATS
       Due to limitations in both X and UNIX, resize propagation is weak.

       When the master user resizes the xterm, all the other xterms are  logi-
       cally  resized.  Unfortunately, xkibitz cannot force the physical xterm
       size to correspond with the logical xterm sizes.

       The other users are free to resize their xterm but their sizes are  not
       propagated.   The  master can check the logical sizes with the &quot;=&quot; com-
       mand.

       Deducing the window size is a  non-portable  operation.   The  code  is
       known  to  work  for  recent  versions of SunOS, AIX, Unicos, and HPUX.
       Send back mods if you add support for anything else.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variable SHELL is used to determine and start a  shell,
       if no other program is given on the command line.

       If  the  environment variable DISPLAY is defined, its value is used for
       the display name of the xkibitz master (the display with tag number 0).
       Otherwise this name remains empty.

       Additional  arguments  may be passed to new xterms through the environ-
       ment variable XKIBITZ_XTERM_ARGS.  For example, to create xterms with a
       scrollbar and a green pointer cursor:

            XKIBITZ_XTERM_ARGS=&quot;-sb -ms green&quot;
            export XKIBITZ_XTERM_ARGS

       (this  is for the Bourne shell - use whatever syntax is appropriate for
       your favorite shell). Any option can be given that  is  valid  for  the
       xterm  command,  with  the  exception  of -display, -geometry and -S as
       those are set by xkibitz.

KIBITZ(1)                   General Commands Manual                  KIBITZ(1)

NAME
       kibitz - allow two people to interact with one shell

SYNOPSIS
       kibitz [ kibitz-args ] user [ program program-args...  ]
       kibitz [ kibitz-args ] user@host [ program program-args...  ]

INTRODUCTION
       kibitz  allows  two (or more) people to interact with one shell (or any
       arbitrary program).  Uses include:

              o   A novice user can ask an expert user for help.   Using  kib-
                  itz,  the  expert  can see what the user is doing, and offer
                  advice or show how to do it right.

              o   By running kibitz and then starting  a  full-screen  editor,
                  people  may  carry out a conversation, retaining the ability
                  to scroll backwards, save the entire conversation,  or  even
                  edit it while in progress.

              o   People  can team up on games, document editing, or other co-
                  operative tasks where each person has  strengths  and  weak-
                  nesses that complement one another.

USAGE
       To  start  kibitz,  user1  runs kibitz with the argument of the user to
       kibitz.  For example:

            kibitz user2

       kibitz starts a new shell (or another program, if given on the  command
       line),  while  prompting  user2 to run kibitz.  If user2 runs kibitz as
       directed, the keystrokes of both users become the input of  the  shell.
       Similarly, both users receive the output from the shell.

       To terminate kibitz it suffices to terminate the shell itself.  For ex-
       ample, if either user types ^D (and the shell accepts this to be  EOF),
       the shell terminates followed by kibitz.

       Normally, all characters are passed uninterpreted.  However, if the es-
       cape character (described when kibitz starts) is issued, the  user  may
       talk  directly to the kibitz interpreter.  Any Expect(1) or Tcl(3) com-
       mands may be given.  Also, job control may be used while in the  inter-
       preter, to, for example, suspend or restart kibitz.

       Various  processes  can  provide various effects.  For example, you can
       emulate a two-way write(1) session with the command:

            kibitz user2 sleep 1000000

ARGUMENTS
       kibitz takes arguments, these should also be separated by whitespace.

       The -noproc flag runs kibitz with no  process  underneath.   Characters
       are  passed  to the other kibitz.  This is particularly useful for con-
       necting multiple interactive processes together.  In this mode, charac-
       ters are not echoed back to the typist.

       -noescape disables the escape character.

       -escape  char  sets the escape character.  The default escape character
       is ^].

       -silent turns off informational messages describing what kibitz is  do-
       ing to initiate a connection.

       -tty ttyname defines the tty to which the invitation should be sent.

       If  you  start  kibitz to user2 on a remote computer, kibitz performs a
       rlogin to the remote computer with  your  current  username.  The  flag
       -proxy  username  causes  rlogin  to  use username for the remote login
       (e.g. if your account on the remote computer has a different username).
       If the -proxy flag is not given, kibitz tries to determine your current
       username by (in that order) inspecting the environment  variables  USER
       and LOGNAME, then by using the commands whoami and logname.

       The  arguments  -noescape  and  -escape can also be given by user2 when
       prompted to run kibitz.

MORE THAN TWO USERS
       The current implementation of kibitz explicitly  understands  only  two
       users,  however,  it  is nonetheless possible to have a three (or more)
       -way kibitz, by kibitzing another kibitz.  For example,  the  following
       command runs kibitz with the current user, user2, and user3:

            % kibitz user2 kibitz user3

       Additional  users  may  be added by simply appending more &quot;kibitz user&quot;
       commands.

       The xkibitz script is similar to kibitz but supports the ability to add
       additional users (and drop them) dynamically.

CAVEATS
       kibitz  assumes the 2nd user has the same terminal type and size as the
       1st user.  If this assumption is incorrect, graphical programs may dis-
       play oddly.

       kibitz  handles  character graphics, but cannot handle bitmapped graph-
       ics.  Thus,

            % xterm -e kibitz    will work
            % kibitz xterm       will not work

       However, you can get the effect of the latter command by using  xkibitz
       (see  SEE  ALSO  below).   kibitz  uses the same permissions as used by
       rlogin, rsh, etc.  Thus, you can only kibitz  to  users  at  hosts  for
       which  you can rlogin.  Similarly, kibitz will prompt for a password on
       the remote host if rlogin would.

       If you kibitz to users at remote hosts,  kibitz  needs  to  distinguish
       your  prompt from other things that may precede it during login.  (Ide-
       ally, the end of it is preferred but any part should suffice.)  If  you
       have  an  unusual prompt, set the environment variable EXPECT_PROMPT to
       an egrep(1)-style regular expression.  Brackets should be preceded with
       one  backslash  in  ranges, and three backslashes for literal brackets.
       The default prompt r.e. is &quot;($|%|#) &quot;.

       kibitz requires the kibitz program on both hosts.  kibitz requires  ex-
       pect(1).

       By  comparison,  the  xkibitz script uses the X authorization mechanism
       for inter-host communication so it does not need  to  login,  recognize
       your  prompt,  or  require  kibitz on the remote host.  It does however
       need permission to access the other X servers.

BUGS
       An early version of Sun's tmpfs had a bug in it that causes  kibitz  to
       blow  up.   If  kibitz reports &quot;error flushing ...: Is a directory&quot; ask
       Sun for patch #100174.

       If your Expect is not compiled with multiple-process support (i.e., you
       do not have a working select or poll), you will not be able to run kib-
       itz.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variable SHELL is used to determine the shell to start,
       if no other program is given on the command line.

       If the environment variable EXPECT_PROMPT exists, it is taken as a reg-
       ular expression which matches the end of your login  prompt  (but  does
       not otherwise occur while logging in). See also CAVEATS above.

       If the environment variables USER or LOGNAME are defined, they are used
       to determine the current user name for a kibitz to a  remote  computer.
       See description of the -proxy option in ARGUMENTS above.

MULTIXTERM(1)               General Commands Manual              MULTIXTERM(1)

NAME
       multixterm - drive multiple xterms separately or together

SYNOPSIS
       multixterm [ args ]

DESCRIPTION
       Multixterm creates multiple xterms that can be driven together or sepa-
       rately.

       In its simplest form, multixterm is run with no arguments and  commands
       are  interactively  entered in the first entry field.  Press return (or
       click the &quot;new xterm&quot; button) to create a new xterm running  that  com-
       mand.

       Keystrokes  in  the &quot;stdin window&quot; are redirected to all xterms started
       by multixterm.  xterms may be driven separately simply by  focusing  on
       them.

       The  stdin  window must have the focus for keystrokes to be sent to the
       xterms.  When it has the focus, the color changes  to  aquamarine.   As
       characters  are entered, the color changes to green for a second.  This
       provides feedback since characters are not echoed in the stdin window.

       Typing in the stdin window while holding down  the  alt  or  meta  keys
       sends  an  escape character before the typed characters.  This provides
       support for programs such as emacs.

ARGUMENTS
              -xa The optional -xa argument indicates  arguments  to  pass  to
                  xterm.

              -xc The  optional  -xc argument indicates a command to be run in
                  each named xterm (see -xn).  With no -xc argument, the  com-
                  mand is the current shell.

              -xd The  optional  -xd  argument indicates a directory to search
                  for files that will appear in the Files menu.   By  default,
                  the directory is: ~/lib/multixterm

              -xf The  optional  -xf  argument  indicates a file to be read at
                  startup.  See FILES below for more info.

              -xn The optional -xn argument indicates a name for  each  xterm.
                  This name will also be substituted for any %n in the command
                  argument (see -xc).

              -xv The optional -xv flag puts multixterm into  a  verbose  mode
                  where it will describe some of the things it is doing inter-
                  nally.  The verbose output is not intended to be understand-
                  able to anyone but the author.

       Less  common  options may be changed by the startup file (see FILES be-
       low).

       All the usual X and wish flags are supported (i.e.,  -display,  -name).
       There are so many of them that to avoid colliding and make them easy to
       remember, all the multixterm flags begin with -x.

       If any arguments do not match the flags above,  the  remainder  of  the
       command  line  is  made available for user processing.  By default, the
       remainder is used as a list of xterm names in the style  of  -xn.   The
       default  behavior  may be changed using the .multixtermrc file (see DOT
       FILE below).

EXAMPLE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
       The following command line starts up two xterms using ssh to the  hosts
       bud and dexter.

            multixterm -xc &quot;ssh %n&quot; bud dexter

FILES
       Command  files may be used to drive or initialize multixterm.  The File
       menu may be used to invoke other files.  If files exist in the  command
       file  directory  (see  -xd  above),  they will appear in the File menu.
       Files may also be loaded by using File-&gt;Open.  Any filename is  accept-
       able but the File-&gt;Open browser defaults to files with a .mxt suffix.

       Files  are  written  in  Tcl and may change any variables or invoke any
       procedures.  The primary variables of  interest  are  'xtermCmd'  which
       identifies  the  command  (see -xc) and 'xtermNames' which is a list of
       names (see -xn).  The procedure xtermStartAll, starts xterms  for  each
       name  in the list.  Other variables and procedures may be discovered by
       examining multixterm itself.

EXAMPLE FILE
       The following file does the same thing as the earlier  example  command
       line:

            # start two xterms connected to bud and dexter
            set xtermCmd &quot;ssh %n&quot;
            set xtermNames {bud dexter}
            xtermStartAll

DOT FILE
       At startup, multixterm reads ~/.multixtermrc if present.  This is simi-
       lar to the command files (see FILES above)  except  that  .multixtermrc
       may  not  call xtermStartAll.  Instead it is called implicitly, similar
       to the way that it is implicit in the command line use of -xn.

       The following example .multixtermrc file makes every xterm run  ssh  to
       the hosts named on the command line.

            set xtermCmd &quot;ssh %n&quot;

       Then multixterm could be called simply:

            multixterm bud dexter

       If  any command-line argument does not match a multixterm flag, the re-
       mainder of the command line is made available to .multixtermrc  in  the
       argv  variable.  If argv is non-empty when .multixtermrc returns, it is
       assigned to xtermNames unless xtermNames is non-empty  in  which  case,
       the content of argv is ignored.

       Commands  from  multixterm are evaluated early in the initialization of
       multixterm.  Anything that must be  done  late  in  the  initialization
       (such  as adding additional bindings to the user interface) may be done
       by putting the commands inside a procedure called &quot;initLate&quot;.

MENUS
       Except as otherwise noted, the menus are self-explanatory.  Some of the
       menus  have  dashed  lines  as the first entry.  Clicking on the dashed
       lines will &quot;tear off&quot; the menus.

USAGE SUGGESTION - ALIASES AND COMMAND FILES
       Aliases may be used to store lengthy command-line invocations.  Command
       files  can be also be used to store such invocations as well as provid-
       ing a convenient way to share configurations.

       Tcl is a general-purpose language.  Thus multixterm command  files  can
       be extremely flexible, such as loading hostnames from other programs or
       files that may change from day-to-day.  In addition, command files  can
       be  used for other purposes.  For example, command files may be used to
       prepared common canned interaction sequences.  For example, the command
       to send the same string to all xterms is:

           xtermSend &quot;a particularly long string&quot;

       The  File  menu  (torn-off)  makes canned sequences particularly conve-
       nient.  Interactions could also be bound to a mouse button,  keystroke,
       or added to a menu via the .multixtermrc file.

       The  following .multixtermrc causes tiny xterms to tile across and down
       the screen.  (You may have to adjust the parameters for  your  screen.)
       This can be very helpful when dealing with large numbers of xterms.

           set yPos 0
           set xPos 0

           trace variable xtermArgs r traceArgs

           proc traceArgs {args} {
               global xPos yPos
               set ::xtermArgs &quot;-geometry 80x12+$xPos+$yPos -font 6x10&quot;
               if {$xPos} {
                   set xPos 0
                   incr yPos 145
                   if {$yPos &gt; 800} {set yPos 0}
               } else {
                   set xPos 500
               }
           }

       The  xtermArgs variable in the code above is the variable corresponding
       to the -xa argument.

       xterms can be also be created directly.   The  following  command  file
       creates three xterms overlapped horizontally:

           set xPos 0
           foreach name {bud dexter hotdog} {
               set ::xtermArgs &quot;-geometry 80x12+$xPos+0 -font 6x10&quot;
               set ::xtermNames $name
               xtermStartAll
               incr xPos 300
           }

USAGE SUGGESTION - SELECTING HOSTS BY NICKNAME
       The  following  .multixtermrc  shows an example of changing the default
       handling of the arguments from hostnames to a filename containing host-
       names:

            set xtermNames [exec cat $argv]

       The  following  is  a  variation, retrieving the host names from the yp
       database:

            set xtermNames [exec ypcat $argv]

       The following hardcodes two sets of hosts, so that you can call multix-
       term with either &quot;cluster1&quot; or &quot;cluster2&quot;:

            switch $argv {
                   cluster1 {
                       set xtermNames &quot;bud dexter&quot;
                   }
                   cluster2 {
                       set xtermNames &quot;frank hotdog weiner&quot;
                   }
               }

COMPARE/CONTRAST
       It  is  worth  comparing  multixterm to xkibitz.  Multixterm connects a
       separate process to each xterm.  xkibitz connects the same  process  to
       each xterm.

LIMITATIONS
       Multixterm  provides no way to remotely control scrollbars, resize, and
       most other window system related functions.

       Because xterm has no mechanism for propagating size information to  ex-
       ternal  processes,  particularly  for  character  graphic  applications
       (e.g., vi, emacs), you may have to manually  ensure  that  the  spawned
       process  behind  each  xterm has the correct size.  For example, if you
       create or set the xterm to a size, you may have  to  send  an  explicit
       stty  command with the correct size to the spawned process(es).  Alter-
       natively, you can add the correct size argument when an xterm  is  cre-
       ated (i.e., &quot;-geometry 80x20&quot;).

       Multixterm  can  only  control  new  xterms  that multixterm itself has
       started.

       As a convenience, the File menu shows a limited number  of  files.   To
       show all the files, use File-&gt;Open.

FILES
       $DOTDIR/.multixtermrc   initial command file
       ~/.multixtermrc         fallback command file
       ~/lib/multixterm/       default command file directory

BUGS
       If  multixterm  is killed using an uncatchable kill, the xterms are not
       killed.  This appears to be a bug in xterm itself.

       Send/expect sequences can be done in multixterm  command  files.   How-
       ever, due to the richness of the possibilities, to document it properly
       would take more time than the author has at present.

REQUIREMENTS
       Requires Expect 5.36.0 or later.
       Requires Tk 8.3.3 or later.

       This man page describes version 1.8 of multixterm.

PASSMASS(1)                 General Commands Manual                PASSMASS(1)

NAME
       passmass - change password on multiple machines

SYNOPSIS
       passmass [ host1 host2 host3 ...  ]

INTRODUCTION
       Passmass changes a password on multiple machines.  If you have accounts
       on several machines that do not share password databases, Passmass  can
       help  you keep them all in sync.  This, in turn, will make it easier to
       change them more frequently.

       When Passmass runs, it asks you for the old and new passwords.  (If you
       are changing root passwords and have equivalencing, the old password is
       not used and may be omitted.)

       Passmass understands the &quot;usual&quot; conventions.  Additional arguments may
       be  used  for tuning.  They affect all hosts which follow until another
       argument overrides it.  For example, if you are  known  as  &quot;libes&quot;  on
       host1 and host2, but &quot;don&quot; on host3, you would say:

            passmass host1 host2 -user don host3

       Arguments are:

              -user
                  User  whose  password will be changed.  By default, the cur-
                  rent user is used.

              -rlogin
                  Use rlogin to access host.  (default)

              -slogin
                  Use slogin to access host.

              -ssh
                  Use ssh to access host.

              -telnet
                  Use telnet to access host.

              -program

                  Next argument is a program to run to set the password.   De-
                  fault  is &quot;passwd&quot;.  Other common choices are &quot;yppasswd&quot; and
                  &quot;set passwd&quot; (e.g., VMS hosts).   A  program  name  such  as
                  &quot;password  fred&quot;  can  be used to create entries for new ac-
                  counts (when run as root).

              -prompt
                  Next argument is a prompt suffix pattern.  This  allows  the
                  script  to know when the shell is prompting.  The default is
                  &quot;# &quot; for root and &quot;% &quot; for non-root accounts.

              -timeout
                  Next argument is the number  of  seconds  to  wait  for  re-
                  sponses.   Default is 30 but some systems can be much slower
                  logging in.

              -su

                  Next argument is  1  or  0.   If  1,  you  are  additionally
                  prompted  for a root password which is used to su after log-
                  ging in.  root's password is changed rather than the user's.
                  This is useful for hosts which do not allow root to log in.

HOW TO USE
       The  best way to run Passmass is to put the command in a one-line shell
       script or alias.  Whenever you get a new account on a new machine,  add
       the  appropriate  arguments  to  the command.  Then run it whenever you
       want to change your passwords on all the hosts.

CAVEATS
       Using the same password on multiple hosts carries risks.   In  particu-
       lar,  if  the  password can be stolen, then all of your accounts are at
       risk.  Thus, you should not use Passmass in situations where your pass-
       word  is  visible,  such as across a network which hackers are known to
       eavesdrop.

       On the other hand, if you have enough  accounts  with  different  pass-
       words,  you  may end up writing them down somewhere - and that can be a
       security problem.  Funny story: my  college  roommate  had  an  11&quot;x13&quot;
       piece of paper on which he had listed accounts and passwords all across
       the Internet.  This was several years worth of careful work and he car-
       ried it with him everywhere he went.  Well one day, he forgot to remove
       it from his jeans, and we found a perfectly blank sheet of  paper  when
       we took out the wash the following day!

TKNEWSBIFF(1)               General Commands Manual              TKNEWSBIFF(1)

NAME
       tknewsbiff - pop up a window when news appears

SYNOPSIS
       tknewsbiff [ server or config-file ]

INTRODUCTION
       tknewsbiff  pops up a window when there is unread news in your favorite
       newsgroups and removes the window after you've read the news.  tknewsb-
       iff can optionally play a sound, start your newsreader, etc.

SELECTING NEWSGROUPS
       By default, the configuration file ~/.tknewsbiff describes how tknewsb-
       iff behaves.  The syntax observes the usual Tcl rules -  however,  even
       if you don't know Tcl, all but the most esoteric configurations will be
       obvious.

       Each newsgroup (or set of newsgroups) to be watched is described by us-
       ing the &quot;watch&quot; command.  For example:

       watch dc.dining
       watch nist.*
       watch comp.unix.wizard  -threshold 3
       watch *.sources.*       -threshold 20

       For each newsgroup pattern, any newsgroup that matches it and which you
       are subscribed to (according to your newsrc file) is eligible  for  re-
       porting.   By  default, tknewsbiff reports on the newsgroup if there is
       at least one unread article.  The &quot;-threshold&quot; flag changes the thresh-
       old  to  the following number.  For example, &quot;-threshold 3&quot; means there
       must be at least three articles unread before  tknewsbiff  will  report
       the newsgroup.

       If  no  watch commands are given (or no configuration file exists), all
       groups which are subscribed to are watched.

       To suppress newsgroups that would otherwise be reported, use  the  &quot;ig-
       nore&quot;  command.   For  example,  the  following  matches all comp.* and
       nist.* newgroups except for nist.posix or .d (discussion) groups:

       watch comp.*
       watch nist.*
       ignore nist.posix.*
       ignore *.d

       The flag &quot;-new&quot; describes a command to be executed when  the  newsgroup
       is  first  reported  as having unread news.  For example, the following
       lines invoke the UNIX command &quot;play&quot; to play a sound.

       watch dc.dining -new &quot;exec play /usr/local/sounds/yumyum.au&quot;
       watch rec.auto* -new &quot;exec play /usr/local/sounds/vroom.au&quot;

       You can cut down on the verbosity of actions  by  defining  procedures.
       For example, if you have many -new flags that all play sound files, you
       could define a sound procedure.  This would allow the  -new  specifica-
       tion to be much shorter.

       proc play {sound} {
            exec play /usr/local/sounds/$sound.au
       }

       watch dc.dining -new &quot;play yumyum&quot;
       watch rec.auto* -new &quot;play vroom&quot;

       As  an aside, you can put an &quot;&amp;&quot; at the end of an &quot;exec&quot; command to get
       commands to execute asynchronously.  However, it's probably not a  good
       idea to do this when playing sound files anyway.

       &quot;newsgroup&quot;  is  a  read-only  variable  which contains the name of the
       newsgroup that is being reported.  This is useful when  the  action  is
       triggered  by a pattern.  For example, the following line could run the
       newsgroup name through a speech synthesizer:

       watch * -new {
            exec play herald.au
            exec speak &quot;New news has arrived in $newsgroup.&quot;
       }

       The flag &quot;-display&quot; describes a command to be executed every  time  the
       newsgroup is reported as having unread news.  The special command &quot;dis-
       play&quot; is the default command.  It schedules $newsgroup to be written to
       tknewsbiff's  display when it is rewritten.  For example, by explicitly
       providing a -display flag that omits the display command, you can  dis-
       able the display of newsgroups that are already reported via -new.

       watch dc.dining -new {exec play yumyum.au} -display {}

       If you want to execute an action repeatedly and still display the news-
       group in the default manner, explicitly invoke the display command  via
       the -display flag.  For example:

       watch *security* -display {
            exec play red-alert.au
            display
       }

       Actions  associated  with the -new and -display flags are executed only
       once for each matching newsgroup.  The command executed is the one  as-
       sociated  with the first pattern in the configuration file that matches
       and observes the given threshold.

       Any command that is simply listed in the configuration file is executed
       each  time  before  the  update  loop in tknewsbiff.  The reserved (but
       user-defined) procedure &quot;user&quot; is run immediately after the  newsgroups
       are scheduled to be written to the display and before they are actually
       written.

       For example, suppose unread articles appear in several rec.auto  groups
       and you play the same sound for each one.  To prevent playing the sound
       several times in a row, make the -new command simply set  a  flag.   In
       the  user  procedure, play the sound if the flag is set (and then reset
       the flag).

       The user procedure could also be used  to  start  a  newsreader.   This
       would  avoid  the possibility of starting multiple newsreaders just be-
       cause multiple newsgroups contained unread articles.  (A check  should,
       of  course,  be made to make sure that a newsreader is not already run-
       ning.)

MORE VARIABLES
       The following example lines show variables that can affect the behavior
       of tknewsbiff

       set delay          120
       set server         news.nist.gov
       set server_timeout 60
       set newsrc         ~/.newsrc
       set width          40
       set height         20
       set active_file    /usr/news/lib/active

       tknewsbiff  alternates  between  checking  for unread news and sleeping
       (kind of like many undergraduates).  The &quot;delay&quot; variable describes how
       many seconds to sleep.

       The  &quot;server&quot;  variable  names  an  NNTP  news-server.   The default is
       &quot;news&quot;.  The &quot;server&quot; variable is only used if the &quot;active_file&quot;  vari-
       able is not set.

       The  &quot;server_timeout&quot;  variable  describes how how many seconds to wait
       for a response from the server before giving up.  -1 means wait forever
       or until the server itself times out.  The default is 60 seconds.

       The  &quot;newsrc&quot; variable describes the name of your .newsrc file.  By de-
       fault, tknewsbiff looks in your home directory for a  newsrc  file.   A
       server-specific  newsrc is used if found.  For example, if you have set
       server to &quot;cubit.nist.gov&quot;, then  tknewsbiff  looks  for  ~/.newsrc-cu-
       bit.nist.gov.   (This is the Emacs gnus convention - which is very con-
       venient when you read news from multiple  servers.)   If  there  is  no
       server-specific newsrc, tknewsbiff uses ~/.newsrc.

       The  &quot;width&quot;  variable  describes the width that tknewsbiff will use to
       display information.  If any newsgroup names are long enough, they will
       be  truncated  so  that the article counts can still be shown.  You can
       manually resize the window to see what was truncated.  However, if your
       configuration file sets the width variable, the window will be restored
       to that size the next time that tknewsbiff checks for unread  news  and
       updates its display.

       The &quot;height&quot; variable describes the maximum height that tknewsbiff will
       use to display information.  If fewer newsgroups are reported, tknewsb-
       iff  will shrink the window appropriately.  You can manually resize the
       window but if your configuration file sets  the  height  variable,  the
       window  will  be  restored  to  that size the next time that tknewsbiff
       checks for unread news and updates its display.

       The &quot;active_file&quot; variable describes the name of the news active  file.
       If  set,  the  active file is read directly in preference to using NNTP
       (even if the &quot;server&quot; variable is set).  This  is  particularly  useful
       for  testing  out new configuration files since you can edit a fake ac-
       tive file and then click button 2 to immediately see how tknewsbiff re-
       sponds (see BUTTONS below).

       If  the environment variable DOTDIR is set, then its value is used as a
       directory in which to find all dotfiles instead of from the home direc-
       tory.   In  particular,  this affects the tknewsbiff configuration file
       and the .newsrc file (assuming the newsrc variable is not  set  explic-
       itly).

WATCHING DIFFERENT NEWS SERVERS
       To  watch  multiple servers, run tknewsbiff multiple times.  (Since you
       need different .newsrc files and the servers have different  newsgroups
       and article numbers anyway, there is no point in trying to do this in a
       single process.)

       You can point tknewsbiff at a different server with an appropriate  ar-
       gument.  The argument is tried both as a configuration file name and as
       a suffix to the string &quot;~/.tknewsbiff-&quot;.  So if you want to  watch  the
       server  &quot;kidney&quot;,  store  the  tknewsbiff  configuration information in
       ~/.tknewsbiff-kidney&quot;.  The following two commands will both  use  that
       configuration file.

            tknewsbiff kidney
            tknewsbiff ~/.tknewsbiff-kidney

       In  both cases, the actual server to contact is set by the value of the
       server variable in the configuration file.

       If no configuration file is found, the argument is used as  the  server
       to contact.  This allows tknewsbiff to be run with no preparation what-
       soever.

       If the argument is the special keyword &quot;active&quot; (or ends in &quot;/active&quot;),
       it is used as the name of an active file.  This is in turn used to ini-
       tialize the variable &quot;active_file&quot; so that tknewsbiff  reads  from  the
       active file directly rather than using NNTP.

       Creating  your own active file is a convenient way of testing your con-
       figuration file.  For example, after running the following command, you
       can repeatedly edit your active file and trigger the update-now command
       (either by pressing button 2 or setting the delay variable very low) to
       see how tknewsbiff responds.

       The active file must follow the format of a real active file.  The for-
       mat is one newsgroup per line.  After the newsgroup name is the  number
       of  the highest article, the lowest article.  Lastly is the letter y or
       m.  m means the newsgroup is moderated.  y means posting is allowed.

WINDOW
       When unread news is found, a window is popped up.  The window lists the
       names  of the newsgroups and the number of unread articles in each (un-
       less suppressed by the -display flag).  When there is no longer any un-
       read  news,  the  window  disappears (although the process continues to
       run).

BUTTONS
       Button or key bindings may be assigned by bind commands.  Feel free  to
       change them.  The default bind commands are:

       bind .list &lt;1&gt; help
       bind .list &lt;2&gt; update-now
       bind .list &lt;3&gt; unmapwindow

       By default button 1 (left) is bound to &quot;help&quot;.  The help command causes
       tknewsbiff to pop up a help window.

       By default, button 2 (middle) is bound to &quot;update-now&quot;.  The update-now
       command  causes  tknewsbiff  to  immediately check for unread news.  If
       your news server is slow or maintains a  very  large  number  of  news-
       groups,  or  you  have a large number of patterns in your configuration
       file, tknewsbiff can take considerable time  before  actually  updating
       the window.

       By  default, button 3 (right) is bound to &quot;unmapwindow&quot;.  The unmapwin-
       dow command causes tknewsbiff to remove the window from the display un-
       til  the next time it finds unread news.  (The mapwindow command causes
       tknewsbiff to restore the window.)

       As an example, here is a binding to pop up an xterm and run rn when you
       hold down the shift key and press button 1 in the listing window.

       bind .list &lt;Shift-1&gt; {
            exec xterm -e rn &amp;
       }

       Here  is  a  similar  binding.  However it tells rn to look only at the
       newsgroup that is under the mouse when  you  pressed  it.   (The  &quot;dis-
       play_list&quot; variable is described later in this man page.)

       bind .list &lt;Shift-1&gt; {
            exec xterm -e rn [lindex $display_list [.list nearest %y]] &amp;
       }

OTHER COMMANDS AND VARIABLES
       Built-in  commands already mentioned are: watch, ignore, display, help,
       update-now, unmapwindow, and mapwindow.

       Any Tcl and Tk command can also be given.  In particular, the  list  of
       newsgroups  is stored in the list widget &quot;.list&quot;, and the scroll bar is
       stored in the scrollbar widget &quot;.scroll&quot;.  So for example, if you  want
       to  change  the foreground and background colors of the newsgroup list,
       you can say:

            .list config -bg honeydew1 -fg orchid2

       These can also be controlled by the X resource database as well.   How-
       ever,  the configuration file allows arbitrarily complex commands to be
       evaluated rather than simple assignments.

       Certain Tcl/Tk commands can  disrupt  proper  function  of  tknewsbiff.
       These will probably be obvious to anyone who knows enough to give these
       commands in the first place.  As a simple example, the program  assumes
       the font in the list box is of fixed width.  The newsgroups will likely
       not align if you use a variable-width font.

       The following variables are accessible and can  be  used  for  esoteric
       uses.  All other variables are private.  Private variables and commands
       begin with &quot;_&quot; so you don't need to worry about accidental collisions.

       The array &quot;db&quot; is a database which maintains information about read and
       unread  news.   db($newsgroup,hi)  is  the highest article that exists.
       db($newsgroup,seen) is the highest article that you have read.

       A number of lists maintain interesting information. &quot;active_list&quot; is  a
       list  of  known  newsgroups.   &quot;seen_list&quot; is a list of newsgroups that
       have been seen so far as the -new and -display  flags  are  being  pro-
       cessed.   &quot;previous_seen_list&quot;  is &quot;seen_list&quot; from the previous cycle.
       &quot;ignore_list&quot;  is  the  list   of   newsgroup   patterns   to   ignore.
       &quot;watch_list&quot;  is  the  list  of  newsgroup  patterns  to  watch.  &quot;dis-
       play_list&quot; is the list of newsgroup will be displayed at the  next  op-
       portunity.

UPDATING YOUR FILES
       tknewsbiff  automatically  rereads your configuration file each time it
       wakes up to check for unread news.  To force tknewsbiff to  reread  the
       file  immediately  (such  as  if you are testing a new configuration or
       have just modified your newsrc file), press button  2  in  the  display
       (see BUTTONS above).

CAVEATS
       tknewsbiff  defines the number of unread articles as the highest exist-
       ing article minus the highest article that you've read.  So  if  you've
       read the last article in the newsgroup but no others, tknewsbiff thinks
       there are no unread articles.  (It's impossible to  do  any  better  by
       reading  the active file and it would be very time consuming to do this
       more accurately via NNTP since servers provide no efficient way of  re-
       porting  their own holes in the newsgroups.)  Fortunately, this defini-
       tion is considered a feature by most people.  It allows you to read ar-
       ticles  and  then  mark  them &quot;unread&quot; but not have tknewsbiff continue
       telling you that they are unread.

UNWARRANTED CONCERNS
       Your news administrator may wonder if many people using tknewsbiff  se-
       verely  impact  an NNTP server.  In fact, the impact is negligible even
       when the delay is very low.  To gather all the  information  it  needs,
       tknewsbiff uses a single NNTP query - it just asks for the active file.
       The NNTP server does no computation, formatting, etc, it just sends the
       file.  All the interesting processing happens locally in the tknewsbiff
       program itself.

BUGS
       The man page is longer than the program.

UNBUFFER(1)                 General Commands Manual                UNBUFFER(1)

NAME
       unbuffer - unbuffer output

SYNOPSIS
       unbuffer program [ args ]

INTRODUCTION
       unbuffer  disables the output buffering that occurs when program output
       is redirected from non-interactive programs.  For example, suppose  you
       are  watching  the output from a fifo by running it through od and then
       more.

            od -c /tmp/fifo | more

       You will not see anything until a full page of  output  has  been  pro-
       duced.

       You can disable this automatic buffering as follows:

            unbuffer od -c /tmp/fifo | more

       Normally,  unbuffer  does  not read from stdin.  This simplifies use of
       unbuffer in some situations.  To use unbuffer in a pipeline, use the -p
       flag.  Example:

               process1 | unbuffer -p process2 | process3

CAVEATS
       unbuffer  -p  may appear to work incorrectly if a process feeding input
       to unbuffer exits.  Consider:
               process1 | unbuffer -p process2 | process3

       If process1 exits, process2 may not yet have finished.  It is  impossi-
       ble for unbuffer to know long to wait for process2 and process2 may not
       ever finish, for example, if it is a filter.  For expediency,  unbuffer
       simply  exits  when  it  encounters  an  EOF  from  either its input or
       process2.

       In order to have a version of unbuffer that worked in  all  situations,
       an  oracle would be necessary.  If you want an application-specific so-
       lution, workarounds or hand-coded Expect may be more suitable.  For ex-
       ample, the following example shows how to allow grep to finish process-
       ing when the cat before it finishes first.   Using  cat  to  feed  grep
       would  never require unbuffer in real life.  It is merely a placeholder
       for some imaginary process that may or may not finish.  Similarly,  the
       final  cat at the end of the pipeline is also a placeholder for another
       process.

       $ cat /tmp/abcdef.log | grep abc | cat
       abcdef
       xxxabc defxxx
       $ cat /tmp/abcdef.log | unbuffer grep abc | cat
       $ (cat /tmp/abcdef.log ; sleep 1) | unbuffer grep abc | cat
       abcdef
       xxxabc defxxx
       $

       The man page is longer than the program.

XKIBITZ(1)                  General Commands Manual                 XKIBITZ(1)

NAME
       xkibitz - allow multiple people to interact in an xterm

SYNOPSIS
       xkibitz [ xkibitz-args ] [ program program-args...  ]

INTRODUCTION
       xkibitz allows users in separate xterms to share one shell (or any pro-
       gram that runs in an xterm).  Uses include:

              o   A novice user can ask an expert user for help.  Using  xkib-
                  itz,  the  expert  can see what the user is doing, and offer
                  advice or show how to do it right.

              o   By running xkibitz and then starting a  full-screen  editor,
                  people  may  carry out a conversation, retaining the ability
                  to scroll backwards, save the entire conversation,  or  even
                  edit it while in progress.

              o   People  can team up on games, document editing, or other co-
                  operative tasks where each person has  strengths  and  weak-
                  nesses that complement one another.

              o   If  you  want to have a large number of people do an on-line
                  code walk-through, you can sit two in front of each worksta-
                  tion,  and then connect them all together while you everyone
                  looks at code together in the editor.

USAGE
       To start xkibitz, one user (the master) runs xkibitz with no arguments.

       xkibitz starts a new shell (or another program, if given on the command
       line).  The user can interact normally with the shell, or upon entering
       an escape (described when xkibitz starts) can add users to the interac-
       tion.

       To  add  users,  enter &quot;+ display&quot; where display is the X display name.
       If there is no &quot;:X.Y&quot; in the display name, &quot;:0.0&quot; is assumed.  The mas-
       ter  user must have permission to access each display.  Each display is
       assigned a tag - a small integer which can be  used  to  reference  the
       display.

       To show the current tags and displays, enter &quot;=&quot;.

       To drop a display, enter &quot;- tag&quot; where tag is the display's tag accord-
       ing to the &quot;=&quot; command.

       To return to the shared shell, enter &quot;return&quot;.  Then the keystrokes  of
       all  users become the input of the shell.  Similarly, all users receive
       the output from the shell.

       To terminate xkibitz it suffices to terminate the  shell  itself.   For
       example,  if  any user types ^D (and the shell accepts this to be EOF),
       the shell terminates followed by xkibitz.

       Normally, all characters are passed uninterpreted.  However, in the es-
       cape  dialogue the user talks directly to the xkibitz interpreter.  Any
       Expect(1) or Tcl(3) commands may also be given.  Also, job control  may
       be  used  while in the interpreter, to, for example, suspend or restart
       xkibitz.

       Various processes can produce various effects.  For  example,  you  can
       emulate a multi-way write(1) session with the command:

            xkibitz sleep 1000000

ARGUMENTS
       xkibitz  understands a few special arguments which should appear before
       the program name (if given).  Each  argument  should  be  separated  by
       whitespace.   If the arguments themselves takes arguments, these should
       also be separated by whitespace.

       -escape sets the escape character.  The default escape character is ^].

       -display adds a display much like the &quot;+&quot; command.   Multiple  -display
       flags  can be given.  For example, to start up xkibitz with three addi-
       tional displays:

            xkibitz -display mercury -display fox -display dragon:1.0

CAVEATS
       Due to limitations in both X and UNIX, resize propagation is weak.

       When the master user resizes the xterm, all the other xterms are  logi-
       cally  resized.  Unfortunately, xkibitz cannot force the physical xterm
       size to correspond with the logical xterm sizes.

       The other users are free to resize their xterm but their sizes are  not
       propagated.   The  master can check the logical sizes with the &quot;=&quot; com-
       mand.

       Deducing the window size is a  non-portable  operation.   The  code  is
       known  to  work  for  recent  versions of SunOS, AIX, Unicos, and HPUX.
       Send back mods if you add support for anything else.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variable SHELL is used to determine and start a  shell,
       if no other program is given on the command line.

       If  the  environment variable DISPLAY is defined, its value is used for
       the display name of the xkibitz master (the display with tag number 0).
       Otherwise this name remains empty.

       Additional  arguments  may be passed to new xterms through the environ-
       ment variable XKIBITZ_XTERM_ARGS.  For example, to create xterms with a
       scrollbar and a green pointer cursor:

            XKIBITZ_XTERM_ARGS=&quot;-sb -ms green&quot;
            export XKIBITZ_XTERM_ARGS

       (this  is for the Bourne shell - use whatever syntax is appropriate for
       your favorite shell). Any option can be given that  is  valid  for  the
       xterm  command,  with  the  exception  of -display, -geometry and -S as
       those are set by xkibitz.
