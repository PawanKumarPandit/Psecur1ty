&lt;p>Until recently we used to have a Docker image named simply &lt;code>kali&lt;/code>, and it was built from the last &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/releases/">versioned release&lt;/a> of Kali (e.g. 2019.4, 2020.1, etc.) matching our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/kali-branches/">&amp;ldquo;kali-last-snapshot&amp;rdquo; network repositories branch&lt;/a>. In a way, this is our &amp;ldquo;stable&amp;rdquo; release, as it will only get updates quarterly as it is in synchronisation with our release cycle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We still provide this &lt;strong>Docker image&lt;/strong>, but now it has been &lt;strong>renamed from &lt;code>kali&lt;/code> to &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kalilinux/kali-last-release">&lt;code>kali-last-release&lt;/code>&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> for clarity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The old &lt;code>kali&lt;/code> Docker image is still around for the time being, but if you use it you will see a deprecation warning to indicate that it is in the &lt;strong>process of being phased out&lt;/strong>. The rest of the deprecation plan is as follow:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Upon Kali &lt;code>2022.1&lt;/code> release, we will update the image to make it fail, meaning that the container will error out with a helpful message when you try to run it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upon Kali &lt;code>2022.2&lt;/code> release, we will completely remove it from &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kalilinux/">our Docker Hub&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So if you still use this image in your scripts or Dockerfiles, &lt;strong>please update&lt;/strong> those and use &lt;code>kali-last-release&lt;/code> instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An additional reminder: if you are after the &lt;strong>most up-to-date version of Kali, you probably want to use the &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kalilinux/kali-last-release">kali-rolling&lt;/a> Docker image&lt;/strong>. This is the &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; image &lt;em>(which matches our other platforms)&lt;/em>, and it is updated every week &lt;em>(the network packages get updated daily also like all other Kali platforms)&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For lots more details, please refer to our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/containers/official-kalilinux-docker-images/">official Kali Docker documentation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you and happy 11111100110!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS &amp;ndash; On a related topic: the Kali images were recently added to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/shortnames">containers shortnames list&lt;/a>. It means that &lt;strong>Podman users&lt;/strong> can run a Kali container simply by typing &lt;code>podman run -it kali-rolling&lt;/code>, rather than using the full image name &lt;code>docker.io/kalilinux/kali-rolling&lt;/code>. This works if the host system provides a very up-to-date shortnames list in &lt;code>/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/shortnames.conf&lt;/code>. &lt;em>If your host system is Kali Rolling, that&amp;rsquo;s already the case!&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux 2021.4 Release</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-4-release/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-4-release/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-4-release/images/banner-2021.4-release.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>With the end of 2021 just around the corner, we are pushing out the last &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/releases/">release&lt;/a> of the year with &lt;strong>Kali Linux 2021.4&lt;/strong>, which is ready for immediate &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/">download&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/">updating&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="kali-on-the-apple-m1">Kali on the Apple M1&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As we announced in &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-1-release">Kali 2021.1&lt;/a> we supported installing Kali Linux on Parallels on Apple Silicon Macs, well with 2021.4, we now also support it on the &lt;a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/2021/09/fusion-for-m1-public-tech-preview-now-available.html">VMware Fusion Public Tech Preview&lt;/a> thanks to the &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/linux">5.14 kernel&lt;/a> having the modules needed for the virtual GPU used. We also have updated the &lt;code>open-vm-tools&lt;/code> &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/open-vm-tools">package&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/debian-installer">Kali&amp;rsquo;s installer&lt;/a> will automatically detect if you are installing under VMware and install the &lt;code>open-vm-tools-desktop&lt;/code> package, which should allow you to change the resolution out of the box. As a reminder, this is still a &lt;em>preview&lt;/em> from VMware, so there may be some rough edges. There is no extra &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-vmware-guest-vm/">documentation&lt;/a> for this because the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/hard-disk-install/">installation process&lt;/a> is the same as VMWare on 64-bit and 32-bit Intel systems, just using the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/">arm64 ISO&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a reminder, virtual machines on &lt;strong>Apple Silicon are still limited to arm64 architecture only&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="extended-compatibility-for-the-samba-client">Extended Compatibility for the Samba Client&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Starting Kali Linux 2021.4, the &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/samba">Samba&lt;/a> client is now configured for &lt;strong>Wide Compatibility&lt;/strong> so that it can connect to pretty much every Samba server out there, regardless of the version of the protocol in use. This change should make it easier to discover vulnerable Samba servers &amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo;, without having to configure Kali.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This setting can be changed easily via the command-line tool &lt;code>kali-tweaks&lt;/code>. In the &lt;em>Hardening&lt;/em> section, one can choose the value &lt;strong>Default&lt;/strong> instead, which reverts back to Samba&amp;rsquo;s usual default, and only allow using modern versions of the Samba protocol.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-4-release/images/kali-tweaks-hardening.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As one can see on this screenshot, there&amp;rsquo;s also a similar setting for &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/openssl">OpenSSL&lt;/a>. You might want to refer to the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-3-release/">2021.3 release announcement&lt;/a> for more details on this setting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="easy-package-manager-mirror-configuration">Easy Package Manager Mirror Configuration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>By default, when a Kali system is updated, the package manager (&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/apt">APT&lt;/a>) downloads packages from a &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/kali-linux-sources-list-repositories/">community mirror&lt;/a> nearby. But did you know that it&amp;rsquo;s also possible to configure Kali to get its package from the &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-repositories-ftw/">CloudFlare CDN&lt;/a>? To be honest, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-3-release/">this is old news&lt;/a>. But what&amp;rsquo;s new is that you can now use &lt;code>kali-tweaks&lt;/code> to quickly configure whether APT should use community mirrors or the CloudFlare CDN.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-4-release/images/kali-tweaks-mirrors.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So which one is best, community mirrors or CloudFlare CDN? There&amp;rsquo;s no good answer. The time that it actually takes to update Kali can vary greatly and depends on many factors, including the speed of your Internet connection, your location, and even the time of day, if ever you live in a place where Internet traffic jam occurs at rush hour. The point is: if ever Kali updates are slow, the best you can do is to try to switch from community mirrors to CloudFlare CDN, or the other way round, and find what works best for you. And with &lt;code>kali-tweaks&lt;/code>, it&amp;rsquo;s never been easier!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kaboxer-theme-support">Kaboxer Theme Support&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With the latest update of &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/kaboxer">Kaboxer&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> tools no longer look out of place, as it brings &lt;strong>support for window themes and icon themes&lt;/strong> (placed respectively inside &lt;code>/usr/share/themes&lt;/code> and &lt;code>/usr/share/icons&lt;/code>). This allows the program to properly integrate with the rest of the desktop and avoids the usage of ugly fallback themes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a comparison of how zenmap (&lt;strong>zenmap-kbx&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/zenmap-kbx">package&lt;/a>) looks with the default Kali Dark theme, compared to the old appearance:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-4-release/images/kaboxer-theme-support.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-tools-in-kali">New Tools in Kali&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It would not be a Kali release if there were not any new tools added! A quick run down of what&amp;rsquo;s been added &lt;em>(to the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/kali-linux-sources-list-repositories/">network repositories&lt;/a>)&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/dufflebag">Dufflebag&lt;/a> - Search exposed EBS volumes for secrets&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/maryam">Maryam&lt;/a> - Open-source Intelligence (OSINT) Framework&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/name-that-hash">Name-That-Hash&lt;/a> - Do not know what type of hash it is? Name That Hash will name that hash type!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/proxmark3">Proxmark3&lt;/a> - if you are into Proxmark3 and RFID hacking&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/rev-proxy-grapher">Reverse Proxy Grapher&lt;/a> - graphviz graph illustrating your reverse proxy flow&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/s3scanner">S3Scanner&lt;/a> - Scan for open S3 buckets and dump the contents&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/spraykatz">Spraykatz&lt;/a> - Credentials gathering tool automating remote procdump and parse of lsass process.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/trufflehog">truffleHog&lt;/a> - Searches through git repositories for high entropy strings and secrets, digging deep into commit history&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/wotmate">Web of trust grapher (wotmate)&lt;/a> - reimplement the defunct PGP pathfinder without needing anything other than your own keyring&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="desktop--theme-enhancement">Desktop &amp;amp; Theme Enhancement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This release brings updates for all the 3 main desktops (&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/xfce4">Xfce&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/gnome-shell">GNOME&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/kde-plasma-desktop">KDE&lt;/a>), but one that is common to all of them is the &lt;strong>new window buttons design&lt;/strong>. Previous buttons were designed to fit the window theme of Xfce but did not work well with the other desktops and lacked personality. The new design looks elegant on any of the desktops and makes it easier to spot the currently focused window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-4-release/images/new-window-buttons.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="xfce">Xfce&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The panel layout has been tweaked to optimize horizontal space and make room for 2 new widgets: the &lt;strong>CPU usage widget&lt;/strong> and the &lt;strong>VPN IP widget&lt;/strong>, which remains hidden unless a VPN connection is established.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the steps of other desktops, the &lt;strong>task manager&lt;/strong> has been configured to &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;icons only&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>, which, with the slight increase in the panel&amp;rsquo;s height, makes the overall look cleaner and improves multitasking in smaller displays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>workspaces overview&lt;/strong> has been configured to the &amp;ldquo;Buttons&amp;rdquo; appearance, as the previous configuration &amp;ldquo;Miniature view&amp;rdquo; was too wide and a bit confusing for some users. Now that each workspace button takes less space in the panel, we have &lt;strong>increased the default number of workspaces to 4&lt;/strong>, as it&amp;rsquo;s a usual arrangement in Linux desktops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To finish with the modifications, a shortcut to &lt;strong>PowerShell&lt;/strong> has been added to the terminals dropdown menu. With this addition, you can now choose between the regular terminal, root terminal, and PowerShell.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="notices info" >
&lt;p>
If you prefer the previous configuration for any of the widgets, you can modify or remove them by pressing &lt;code>Ctrl + Right-Click&lt;/code> over it.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-4-release/images/xfce-layout-updates.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to the Xfce design tweaks, In the image above, we can also observe the new &lt;strong>customized prompt for PowerShell&lt;/strong> (in the two-line mode). Same as for &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/zsh">zsh&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/bash">bash&lt;/a>, it includes an alternative one-line prompt that can be configured with &lt;code>kali-tweaks&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bonus Tips For Virtual Desktops!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You can add or remove workspaces with the shortcuts: &lt;code>Alt + Insert&lt;/code> / &lt;code>Alt + Delete&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can move through workspaces with the shortcuts:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Ctrl + Alt + &amp;lt;ARROW_KEY&amp;gt;&lt;/code> to move in the direction of the arrow key.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>(if you add &lt;code>Shift&lt;/code> you move the current focused window)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Ctrl + Alt + &amp;lt;WORKSPACE_NUM&amp;gt;&lt;/code> to move to a specific workspace, based on its number.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Ctrl + Super + &amp;lt;WORKSPACE_NUM&amp;gt;&lt;/code> to move a window to a specific workspace, based on its number.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-4-release/images/workspaces-shortcuts-demo.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="gnome-41">GNOME 41&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In this update, GNOME desktop has received not one, but two version bumps. It&amp;rsquo;s been one year since the last major update of the GNOME desktop in Kali (with GNOME 3.38) and since then there have been two releases of the desktop environment:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/40.0/">Introducing GNOME 40&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/41.0/">Introducing GNOME 41&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All themes and extensions have been updated to support the new shell:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-4-release/images/gnome41.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-4-release/images/gnome41-overview.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="kde-523">KDE 5.23&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The KDE team celebrated its 25th anniversary releasing the update &lt;a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.23.0/">5.23&lt;/a> of the &lt;strong>Plasma&lt;/strong> desktop. This update, now available in Kali, brings a &lt;strong>new design for the Breeze theme&lt;/strong>, which improves the look of Plasma with details that add glossiness and style to the desktop. Along with the theme improvements, the &lt;em>System Settings&lt;/em> (Under &lt;em>Global Theme &amp;gt; Colors&lt;/em>) brings a &lt;em>new option to pick the desktop &lt;strong>accent color&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From Kali&amp;rsquo;s side, the new window theme for KDE is now based on the source code of the breeze theme instead of using the &lt;em>Aurorae&lt;/em> theme engine. This fixes previous issues with window scaling for &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/hidpi/">HiDPI displays&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-to-upgrade-your-kali-theme">How to Upgrade Your Kali Theme&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>With these theme changes, you &lt;strong>may not get them if you &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/">upgrade&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> Kali. This is because the &lt;strong>theme settings&lt;/strong> are &lt;strong>copied&lt;/strong> to your &lt;strong>home folder&lt;/strong> when your &lt;strong>user is first created&lt;/strong>. When you upgrade Kali, it is &lt;strong>upgrading the operating system&lt;/strong>, so upgrading &lt;strong>does not alter personal files&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(just system files)&lt;/em>. As a result, in order to get these theme tweaks, you need to either:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do a fresh Kali install&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a new user and switch to that&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Delete your Desktop environment profile for the current user and force reboot. Example of Xfce can be found below:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ mv ~/.config/xfce4{,-$(date +%Y.%m.%d-%H.%M.%S)}
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ cp -rbi /etc/skel/. ~/
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ xfce4-session-logout --reboot --fast
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="kali-nethunter-updates">Kali NetHunter Updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-4-release/images/NH-SET.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to the amazing work of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yesimxev">@yesimxev&lt;/a>, we have a new addition to the NetHunter app: &lt;strong>The Social-Engineer Toolkit!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This release features the first module from SET: the Spear Phishing Email Attack, with many more to come - watch this space&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now you can use the Kali NetHunter app to customise your own Facebook, Messenger, or Twitter direct message email notifications for your social engineering attacks:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="kali-arm-updates">Kali ARM Updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Notable changes this release&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>All images now use ext4 for their root filesystem&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>resize the root filesystem on first boot&lt;/strong>. This results in a speed-up over previous releases which were using ext3, and a reduced boot time on the first reboot when resize happens.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W support has been added&lt;/strong>, but like the Raspberry Pi 400, there is no Nexmon support.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Speaking of the &lt;strong>Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W&lt;/strong>, since it is so similar to the Zero W, we have also added a &lt;strong>PiTail image&lt;/strong> to support the new processor with better performance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Raspberry Pi images now support USB booting&lt;/strong> out of the box since we no longer hardcode the root device.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Raspberry Pi images now include versioned Nexmon firmware&lt;/strong>. A future release of &lt;code>kalipi-config&lt;/code> will allow you to switch between them, if you would like to test different versions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Images that use a vendor kernel will now be able to set the regulatory domain properly, so &lt;strong>setting your country will give access to channels properly for wireless&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pinebook Pro can now be overclocked&lt;/strong>. The big cores get 2GHz and the little cores get 1.5GHz added.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost&lt;/code> to enable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost&lt;/code> to disable&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>USBArmory MkII image has been added&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm">Kali ARM build-scripts&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> have seen a massive amount of changes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>They are vastly &lt;strong>more simplified&lt;/strong> - thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/frangalinux">Francisco Jose Rodriguez Martos&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/cyrus104">cyrus104&lt;/a> for all of their contributions to make this happen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can now &lt;strong>choose which desktop&lt;/strong> you would like to install (or none at all using &lt;code>--minimal&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is even an option of &lt;strong>no desktop and no tools&lt;/strong> (&lt;code>--slim&lt;/code>) if you would like to build a custom image up from scratch&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="kali-docs-updates">Kali-Docs Updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/tools/flatpak/">Installing Flatpak on Kali Linux&lt;/a> is now well documented&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A new page for the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/">Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W&lt;/a> has been added&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/kali-branches/">Kali branches&lt;/a> page has been refreshed with best practices and references to &lt;code>kali-tweaks&lt;/code> that help you follow those best practices to enable (or disable) some of the supplementary repositories.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We added a &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/tools/removed-tools/">list of removed tools&lt;/a> so that you can learn why a package got dropped from Kali.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thanks also to &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/mayomacam">Aman Kumar Maurya&lt;/a> for the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/install-nvidia-drivers-on-kali-linux/">nVidia&lt;/a> guide&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Anyone can help out, anyone can get &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/community/contribute/">involved&lt;/a>!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Kali-Cloud &amp;amp; Cron&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DHAhole">users&lt;/a> noticed that the venerable &lt;code>cron&lt;/code> &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/cron">package&lt;/a> was missing from the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-cloud">Kali AWS Cloud image&lt;/a>. This was not intentional, and it&amp;rsquo;s now fixed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Remote Desktop Protocol Audio&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;, goes the saying. And for those running Kali in a VM and using RDP to connect, it&amp;rsquo;s been very quiet indeed, as the sound never worked with this configuration. However this long period of silence is coming to an end! Sound should be enabled and work out of the box from now on. If ever it does not, make yourself heard on the &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">bug tracker&lt;/a> ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Python Command&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The command &lt;code>python&lt;/code> is no more! Instead, you need to use &lt;code>python3&lt;/code> (or &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/using-eol-python-versions/">if you have to&lt;/a>, &lt;code>python2&lt;/code> due it being at &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/python-2-end-of-life/">End Of Life&lt;/a>). Alternatively you can install &lt;code>python-is-python3&lt;/code> to restore &lt;code>python&lt;/code> as an alias for &lt;code>python3&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="download-kali-linux-20214">Download Kali Linux 2021.4&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fresh Images&lt;/strong>:
So what are you waiting for? Start &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/">downloading&lt;/a> already!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seasoned Kali Linux users are already aware of this, but for the ones who are not, we do also produce &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/">weekly builds&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> that you can use as well. If you cannot wait for our next release and you want the latest packages &lt;em>(or bug fixes)&lt;/em> when you download the image, you can just use the weekly image instead.
This way you&amp;rsquo;ll have fewer updates to do.
&lt;em>Just know that these are automated builds that we do not QA like we do our standard &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/releases/">release images&lt;/a>&lt;/em>. But we gladly take &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">bug reports&lt;/a> about those images because we want any issues to be fixed before our next release!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Existing Installs&lt;/strong>:
If you already have an existing Kali Linux installation, remember you can always do a quick &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/">update&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ echo &amp;quot;deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib&amp;quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt -y full-upgrade
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ cp -rbi /etc/skel/. ~
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo reboot -f
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You should now be on Kali Linux 2021.4. We can do a quick check by doing:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ grep VERSION /etc/os-release
VERSION=&amp;quot;2021.4&amp;quot;
VERSION_ID=&amp;quot;2021.4&amp;quot;
VERSION_CODENAME=&amp;quot;kali-rolling&amp;quot;
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ uname -v
#1 SMP Debian 5.14.16-1kali1 (2021-11-05)
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ uname -r

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;em>NOTE: The output of &lt;code>uname -r&lt;/code> may be different depending on the system &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/linux">architecture&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As always, should you come across any bugs in Kali, please submit a report on our &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">bug tracker&lt;/a>. &lt;em>We&amp;rsquo;ll never be able to fix what we do not know is broken!&lt;/em> &lt;strong>And &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kalilinux">Twitter&lt;/a> is not a Bug Tracker!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux 2021.3 Release (OpenSSL, Kali-Tools, Kali Live VM Support, Kali NetHunter Smartwatch)</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-3-release/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-3-release/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-3-release/images/banner-2021.3-release.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>Today we have released the newest version of &lt;strong>Kali Linux, 2021.3&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(quarter #3)&lt;/em>, which is now ready for &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/">download&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/">updating&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A summary of the &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/changelog_page.php">changes&lt;/a> since the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-2-release/">2021.2 release from June&lt;/a> are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-3-release/#openssl-wide-compatibility-by-default">OpenSSL&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - Wide compatibility by default - Keep reading for what that means&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-3-release/#kali-tools">New Kali-Tools site&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - Following the footsteps of Kali-Docs, Kali-Tools has had a complete refresh&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-3-release/#virtualization-improvements-all-over-the-place">Better VM support in the Live image session&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - Copy &amp;amp; paste and drag &amp;amp; drop from your machine into a Kali VM by default&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-3-release/#new-tools-in-kali">New tools&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - From adversary emulation, to subdomain takeover to Wi-Fi attacks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-3-release/#kali-nethunter-updates">Kali NetHunter smartwatch&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - First of its kind, for TicHunter Pro&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-3-release/#desktop--theme-updates">KDE 5.21&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - Plasma desktop received a version bump&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="openssl-wide-compatibility-by-default">OpenSSL: wide compatibility by default&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Going forwards from Kali Linux 2021.3, OpenSSL has now been configured for &lt;strong>wider compatibility&lt;/strong> to allow Kali to talk to as many services as possible. This means that legacy protocols &lt;em>(such as TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1)&lt;/em> and older ciphers are &lt;strong>enabled by default&lt;/strong>. This is done to help increase Kali&amp;rsquo;s ability to talk to older, obsolete systems and servers that are still using these older protocols. This may potentially increase your options on available attack surfaces &lt;em>(if your target has these End of Life (EoL) services running, having then forgotten about them, what else could this uncover?)&lt;/em>. While this is not a configuration that would be good for a general purpose operating systems, this setting makes sense for Kali as it enables the user to engage and talk with more potential targets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This setting is easy to modify via the command-line tool &lt;code>kali-tweaks&lt;/code> though. Enter the &lt;em>Hardening&lt;/em> section, and from there you can configure OpenSSL for &lt;strong>Strong Security&lt;/strong> mode instead, which uses today&amp;rsquo;s current modern standard allowing for secure communication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more details, refer to the documentation: &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/openssl-configuration/">kali.org/docs/general-use/openssl-configuration/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-tools">Kali-Tools&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/">2019.4&lt;/a> we moved our documentation over to our updated &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/">/docs/&lt;/a> page. It&amp;rsquo;s now finally the turn of our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/">Kali-Tools&lt;/a> site!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have refreshed every aspect of the previous site, giving a new, faster, layout, content, and system! The backend is now in a semi-automated state and more in the open, which like before, allows for anyone to help out and &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/community/contribute/">contribute&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once these sites have settled down from all the changes and matured a bit, we will start to package these both up, allowing for offline reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-3-release/images/kali-tools.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="virtualization-improvements-all-over-the-place">Virtualization: improvements all over the place&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Kali Live image received some love during this release cycle! We worked hard to make the experience smoother for those who run the Live image in &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/">virtualized environments&lt;/a>. Basic features like &lt;strong>copy&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;paste&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>drag&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;drop&lt;/strong> between the host and the guest should now work out of the box. And this is really for everyone: VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V and QEMU+Spice. Did we forget anyone? Drop us a word on the &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">Kali bug tracker&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the same line: it&amp;rsquo;s now very easy to configure Kali for &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/learn-more/use-local-resources-on-hyper-v-virtual-machine-with-vmconnect">&lt;strong>Hyper-V Enhanced Session Mode&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. Open &lt;code>kali-tweaks&lt;/code> in a terminal, select &lt;code>Virtualization&lt;/code>, and if Kali is running under Hyper-V, you&amp;rsquo;ll see a setting to turn on Hyper-V Enhanced Session Mode. It&amp;rsquo;s now as simple as hitting Enter!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you use this feature, make sure to visit &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-hyper-v-guest-enhanced-session-mode/">kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-hyper-v-guest-enhanced-session-mode/&lt;/a>, as there are a few additional things to be aware of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many thanks to &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/jetbennett">@Shane Bennett&lt;/a>, who spent a tremendous amount of time testing this feature, provided extremely detailed feedback all along, and even helped us with the documentation. Kudos Shane!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-tools-in-kali">New Tools in Kali&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a Kali release if there weren&amp;rsquo;t any new tools added! A quick run down of what&amp;rsquo;s been added &lt;em>(to the network repositories)&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/berate-ap">Berate_ap&lt;/a> - Orchestrating MANA rogue Wi-Fi Access Points&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/caldera">CALDERA&lt;/a> - Scalable automated adversary emulation platform&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-3-release/images/NHWheader.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="kali-nethunter-watch">Kali NetHunter Watch&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We proudly introduce the world&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong>first Kali NetHunter smartwatch, the TicHunter Pro&lt;/strong> thanks to the outstanding work of our very own NetHunter developer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yesimxev">@yesimxev&lt;/a>. It is still experimental, hence the features are limited to USB attacks, and some basic functions. The hardware also has limitations, as such a small battery won&amp;rsquo;t supply enough voltage for any OTG adapters, so huge antennas won&amp;rsquo;t stick out of your wrist! The future is very promising, bringing support for Nexmon and internal bluetooth usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The image is available on our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/">download page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please note that those images contain a &amp;ldquo;nano Kali rootfs&amp;rdquo; due to technical reasons. The detailed installation guide can be found in our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter/installing-nethunter-on-the-ticwatch-pro/">Kali documentation&lt;/a>. Feel free to join the adventure!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="kali-nethunter-installation-via-magisk">Kali NetHunter Installation via Magisk&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Thanks to the amazing work of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Mominul00650279">@Mominul Islam&lt;/a>, we can now bring &lt;strong>Kali NetHunter to Android 11 devices without a fully working TWRP&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each Kali NetHunter image can be flashed as a Magisk module. This work is still in its infancy and more work is needed to bring it up to par with the traditional installer through TWRP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the missing parts is the kernel installation. We haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to install the kernel through Magisk yet. That has to be done via kernel installers like the &amp;ldquo;Franco Kernel Manager&amp;rdquo;. If you are keen to get NetHunter onto your Android 11 device, just give it a crack. If you are interested in helping out with getting the kernel part finished, please get in touch with us through our &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-project/-/issues">GitLab issue tracker&lt;/a>. Any help is greatly appreciated!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="kali-nethunter-installation-step-by-step-guide-for-our-preferred-device-the-oneplus-7">Kali NetHunter installation step-by-step guide for our preferred device, the OnePlus 7&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Our &lt;strong>preferred device for Kali NetHunter is the OnePlus 7 running Android 10 (stock ROM)&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a step-by-step installation guide and links to all the files required to restore your phone to the latest stock Android 10 ROM, install TWRP, Magisk and Kali NetHunter, head over to our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter/installing-nethunter-on-the-oneplus-7/">Kali documentation&lt;/a> page.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-arm-updates">Kali ARM Updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have been busy doing various tweaks and tinkering on our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/">Kali ARM images&lt;/a>, which covers:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Our &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm">Kali ARM build-scripts&lt;/a> have been re-worked&lt;/strong>.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Thanks to &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/cyrus104">@cyrus104&lt;/a>, we now have a &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm/-/blob/master/gateworks-newport.sh">build-script to support the &lt;strong>Gateworks Newport&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> board, and he also added &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/gateworks-newport/">documentation&lt;/a> for it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/re4sonkernel">@Re4son&lt;/a> contributed a &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm/-/blob/master/rpi0w-pitail.sh">build-script&lt;/a> for the Raspberry Pi Zero W based &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://whitedome.com.au/re4son/pi-tail/">&amp;ldquo;Pi-Tail&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(Find &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/raspberry-pi-zero-w-pi-tail/">more information here&lt;/a>)&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Additionally, the RaspberryPi Zero W based &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm/-/blob/master/rpi0w-nexmon-p4wnp1-aloa.sh">&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;P4wnP1&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> build-script&lt;/a> has undergone some major changes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All images &lt;em>should&lt;/em> finally &lt;strong>resize the file-system on the first boot&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We now &lt;strong>re-generate the default snakeoil cert&lt;/strong>, which fixes a couple of tools that were failing to run previously.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Images default to &lt;code>iptables-legacy&lt;/code> and &lt;code>ip6tables-legacy&lt;/code> for &lt;strong>iptables support&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We now &lt;strong>set a default locale&lt;/strong> of &lt;code>en_US.UTF-8&lt;/code> on all images, you can, of course, change this to your preferred locale.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>Kali user&lt;/strong> on ARM images is now in all of the &lt;strong>same groups&lt;/strong> as base images by default, and uses &lt;strong>zsh&lt;/strong> for the default shell. You can change your default shell by using the &lt;code>kali-tweaks&lt;/code> tool which also comes pre-installed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Raspberry Pi images can &lt;strong>now use a &lt;code>wpa_supplicant.conf&lt;/code> file on the &lt;code>/boot&lt;/code> partition&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Raspberry Pi images &lt;strong>now come with &lt;code>kalipi-config&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>kalipi-tft-config&lt;/code>&lt;/strong> pre-installed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pinebook Pro&amp;rsquo;s kernel&lt;/strong> has been updated to &lt;strong>5.14&lt;/strong>, and you now get &lt;strong>messages on the LCD screen as it&amp;rsquo;s booting&lt;/strong>, instead of a blinking cursor until X starts.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="desktop--theme-updates">Desktop &amp;amp; Theme Updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are also some changes in the desktop space:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Improved GTK3 theme for Xfce&amp;rsquo;s notifications and logout-dialog&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Redesigned GTK2 theme for a better fit of older programs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improved Kali-Dark and Kali-Light syntax-highlighting themes for GNOME and Xfce&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In addition to these changes, one of Kali&amp;rsquo;s preferred desktops, KDE plasma, has received a version bump, now including version &lt;a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.21.0/">5.21&lt;/a>. This update brings an updated look, with a new application launcher and theme improvements. Here&amp;rsquo;s a preview of how it looks with Kali&amp;rsquo;s customization:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-3-release/images/KDE_5.21.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-docs-updates">Kali-Docs Updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our documentation site, as well as the pages mentioned already in this blog post, the following other pages have received major changes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/introduction/download-images-securely/">Download Kali Linux Images Securely&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/wsl/mesa-21/">Kali Linux &amp;amp; WSL &amp;amp; Mesa&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;p>We participated in GitLab&amp;rsquo;s virtual conference this year and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/g0tmi1k">@g0tmi1k&lt;/a> gave a talk on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7ixTe-6Oyw">Dynamic between Kali Linux and OffSec&lt;/a>. Give it a watch!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ampere--arm">Ampere &amp;amp; ARM&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Following our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/ampere/">announcement&lt;/a> of our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/partnerships-sponsorships/">partnerships&lt;/a> with Ampere, we have now fully moved our ARM package building machines over to their hardware, and loving the speed increase! Thank you again to Ampere for the assistance! If you need some ARM servers give them a look! If they are nice enough to help us out this way, we are sure they will treat you good as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-changes">Upcoming Changes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Looking forward, we are going to be announcing the following changes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Kali-Menu refresh&lt;/strong> - We know you may not use it, but for the people who do, we are planning on making some major alterations in its structure. This will hopefully be &lt;strong>live for testing in 2021.4&lt;/strong>, and then made default in a later release based on user response. You will be able to change the menu layout by using &lt;code>kali-tweaks&lt;/code>. If you want to provide input on this change, get engaged with us and make your voice heard!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Load Balancer&lt;/strong> (http.kali.org &amp;amp; cdimage.kali.org) - This handles apt packages as well as OS images. We will be switching from MirrorBrain to MirrorBits. We will be soon in touch with all the community mirror maintainers to give them notice of our infrastructure changes. If you would like to become a mirror, please see &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/community/setting-up-a-kali-linux-mirror/">our guide&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="download-kali-linux-20213">Download Kali Linux 2021.3&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fresh Images&lt;/strong>:
So what are you waiting for? Start &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/">downloading&lt;/a> already!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seasoned Kali Linux users are already aware of this, but for the those who are not, we do also produce &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/">weekly builds&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> that you can use as well. If you cannot wait for our next release and you want the latest packages &lt;em>(or bug fixes)&lt;/em> when you download the image, you can just use the weekly image instead. This way you&amp;rsquo;ll have fewer updates to do. &lt;em>Just know that these are automated builds that we do not QA like we do our standard &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/releases/">release images&lt;/a>&lt;/em>. But we gladly take &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">bug reports&lt;/a> about those images because we want any issues to be fixed before our next release!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Existing Installs&lt;/strong>:
If you already have an existing Kali Linux installation, remember you can always do a quick &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/">update&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ echo &amp;quot;deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib&amp;quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt -y full-upgrade
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ cp -rbi /etc/skel/. ~
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo reboot -f
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You should now be on Kali Linux 2021.3. We can do a quick check by doing:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ grep VERSION /etc/os-release
VERSION=&amp;quot;2021.3&amp;quot;
VERSION_ID=&amp;quot;2021.3&amp;quot;
VERSION_CODENAME=&amp;quot;kali-rolling&amp;quot;

ââ$ uname -v

&lt;p>&lt;em>NOTE: The output of &lt;code>uname -r&lt;/code> may be different depending on the system &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/linux">architecture&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As always, should you come across any bugs in Kali, please submit a report on our &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">bug tracker&lt;/a>. &lt;em>We&amp;rsquo;ll never be able to fix what we do not know is broken!&lt;/em> &lt;strong>And &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kalilinux">Twitter&lt;/a> is not a Bug Tracker!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux 2021.2 Release (Kaboxer, Kali-Tweaks, Bleeding-Edge &amp; Privileged Ports)</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-2-release/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-2-release/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-2-release/images/banner-2021.2-release.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>Say hello to &lt;strong>Kali Linux 2021.2&lt;/strong>!

&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="introducing-kaboxer-v10-_again_">Introducing Kaboxer v1.0 &lt;em>(Again)&lt;/em>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In case you missed it, we have previously covered &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/kaboxer">Kaboxer&lt;/a> in it&amp;rsquo;s own &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/introducing-kaboxer/">dedicated blog post&lt;/a>, which goes into a lot more detail of why we love it so! For developers, this is a great new tool in the arsenal. Users will, hopefully, &lt;strong>not realise that they are using it&lt;/strong>, only noticing that previously problematic tools now work correctly!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without repeating what has already been posted, this technology allows us to &lt;strong>correctly&lt;/strong> package up programs that were previously difficult, with items such as &lt;strong>complex dependencies&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>legacy programs &amp;amp; libraries&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(such as &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/using-eol-python-versions/">Python 2&lt;/a> or dated SSL/TLS)&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Kaboxer&amp;rsquo;s launch, we have released 3 packages using it:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/covenant-kbx">Covenant&lt;/a> - Daemon using server/client network model&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/firefox-developer-edition-kbx">Firefox (Developer Edition)&lt;/a> - Big GUI desktop application&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/zenmap-kbx">Zenmap&lt;/a> - Legacy libraries &lt;em>(&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/using-eol-python-versions/">Python 2&lt;/a>)&lt;/em> application&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you want to read more, please see either our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/introducing-kaboxer/">blog post&lt;/a> covering it, or our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/packaging-apps-with-kaboxer">documentation&lt;/a> around it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Kaboxer is still in its infancy, so please be nice &amp;amp; patient with it.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="releasing-kali-tweaks-v10">Releasing Kali-Tweaks v1.0&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Announcing &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/kali-tweaks">Kali-Tweaks&lt;/a>! This is our little helping hand for Kali users, with the idea to help &lt;strong>customize Kali to your own personal taste&lt;/strong> quickly, simply, &lt;em>and the correct way&lt;/em>. This should help you to &lt;strong>stop doing repetitive tasks&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-2-release/images/kali-tweaks.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently Kali-Tweaks will help out with:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Metapackages&lt;/strong> - Installing/removing &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/">groups of tools&lt;/a>, which may not have been available while installing Kali if you did not use the installer image&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Network Repositories&lt;/strong> - Enabling/disabling &amp;ldquo;bleeding-edge&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp; &amp;ldquo;experimental&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/kali-branches/">branches&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Shell &amp;amp; Prompt&lt;/strong> - Switch between &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-4-release/">two or one line prompt&lt;/a>, enable/disable the extra line before the prompt, or configure &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-3-release/">Bash or ZSH&lt;/a> as the default shell&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Virtualization&lt;/strong> - Using Kali as a &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/">guest VM&lt;/a>? Do a few actions to make the experience easier!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Our philosophy is to always &lt;strong>understand what you are running&lt;/strong>, before you run it. That way, it reduces the chances of any undesirable nasty surprises. Which is why we will always encourage anyone to do actions &lt;strong>manually before automating&lt;/strong> it, so you get to understand what is happening under the hood. On the flip side, we also understand there is so much to remember. Then when you sprinkle in people&amp;rsquo;s bad habits, which often have long term implications and end up breaking Kali, there is room for improvement. So, we started developing Kali-Tweaks. Where possible, Kali-Tweaks will also &lt;strong>display what commands are being executed to help educate users&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We do want to mention a few things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>kali-tweaks&lt;/code> has been &lt;strong>marked as &amp;ldquo;recommended&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> rather than &amp;ldquo;required&amp;rdquo;. As a result, if you are upgrading Kali, it &lt;strong>may not be included&lt;/strong>. On the other hand, you can remove &lt;code>kali-tweaks&lt;/code> without removing anything else&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On the subject of upgrading; depending on how old your Kali installation is, you may need to &lt;strong>reset your shell resource&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(e.g. &lt;code>.bashrc&lt;/code> &amp;amp; &lt;code>.zshrc&lt;/code>)&lt;/em> before you can use the &amp;ldquo;configure prompt&amp;rdquo; section. This is because it will not have the necessary variables. Should you want to, make sure to &lt;strong>backup, reset, and restore&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The last thing to point out, when changing the default login shell; please &lt;strong>log out and in again&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(either graphically or remote console)&lt;/em> for it to have an effect&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It is still early days with Kali-Tweaks, and we already have ideas of what to expand into, but we welcome &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/kali-tweaks/-/issues">any suggestions from you&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Kali-Tweaks is still in its infancy, so please be nice &amp;amp; patient with it.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="refreshed-bleeding-edge-branch">Refreshed Bleeding-Edge Branch&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Kali&amp;rsquo;s Bleeding-Edge branch has been around since &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/bleeding-edge-kali-repositories/">March 2013&lt;/a>, but we have recently completely &lt;strong>restructured the backend&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those not too familiar with Bleeding-Edge branch, here is a breakdown:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Kali by default opts to be &lt;strong>stable where possible when packaging&lt;/strong>. This means some tools may &lt;strong>appear&lt;/strong> to be &amp;ldquo;out-dated&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We do this by looking to see when the &lt;strong>tool author(s) signals&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;everything up to to this point is good&amp;rdquo;, by doing a &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>point release&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; &lt;em>(e.g. &lt;code>1.0&lt;/code> or &lt;code>2.1&lt;/code>)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Developers often use &lt;strong>source-code version control&lt;/strong>, allowing them to track any changes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How programmers use source-code version control depends on &lt;strong>their work flow, experience, and team size&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Developers can use a &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;tag&amp;rdquo; feature&lt;/strong> found in most source-code version control to signal when there is a new version &lt;em>(this is what Kali prefers)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>However, some people may say &lt;strong>if it makes it to &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; branch&lt;/strong>, then it is &amp;ldquo;production ready&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are times where &lt;strong>it has been &amp;ldquo;a while&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(months or even years)&lt;/em> &lt;strong>since doing a tag&lt;/strong> for a stable release &lt;em>(aka point release)&lt;/em>, and people get frustrated that there are no updates &lt;em>(e.g. &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/hashcat">hashcat&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/impacket">impacket&lt;/a>)&lt;/em>.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In other cases, &lt;strong>you want the latest code&lt;/strong> which may include an exploit 0day &lt;em>(e.g. &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/metasploit-framework">Metasploit-framework&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/powershell-empire">Empire&lt;/a>, or &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/exploitdb">Exploit-DB&lt;/a>)&lt;/em> so waiting for a tag release may &lt;strong>not be an option&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You may then end up skipping the Kali package and compiling your favorite tool&amp;rsquo;s source-code. This might then conflict with Kali&amp;rsquo;s packaging, and it is your responsibility to maintain the program. &lt;strong>This is where bleeding-edge branch comes in.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-roadmap-2019-2020/">moving over to GitLab&lt;/a>, we have been able to create &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/leveraging-the-kali-bot/">Kali-Bot&lt;/a> to help with &lt;strong>heavy lifting and automation&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Automatically package &lt;strong>tag&amp;rsquo;d releases&lt;/strong> to kali-&lt;strong>experimental branch&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automatically package the &lt;strong>last commit&lt;/strong> to kali-&lt;strong>bleeding-edge branch&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is a fully automated procedure, as a result, the testing that goes into our packaging is automated as well &lt;em>(unlike anything that is in kali-rolling branch which has manual testing involved)&lt;/em>. If there has not been a unit test created, its not going to be tested for. This means there is &lt;strong>a chance&lt;/strong> packages will be broken, and more trust goes into the tool author having correctly developed the tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to give it a try, have a look at our &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/kali-bleeding-edge/">kali-bleeding-edge documentation&lt;/a> to learn how to enable&lt;/strong> the repository and how to tell apt to select a package from this repository. &lt;strong>Once the repository has been enabled&lt;/strong>, it looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- Alt: $ sudo apt -y install -t kali-bleeding-edge ffuf -->
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ dpkg -l \
| grep ffuf
ii ffuf 1.3.1-0kali1 amd64 Fast web fuzzer written in Go (program)
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install -y ffuf/kali-bleeding-edge
...
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ dpkg -l \
| grep ffuf
ii ffuf 1.3.1+git20210505.1.f032167-0kali1~jan+nus1 amd64 Fast web fuzzer written in Go (program)
kali@kali:~$
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Not every tool has made it to the new system yet as there are still many limitations to overcome, but to see what is supported and also how many:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ curl -s -L 'http://http.kali.org/kali/dists/kali-bleeding-edge/main/binary-amd64/Packages' \
| awk -F ': ' '/^Package: /{print $2}'
...
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ curl -s -L 'http://http.kali.org/kali/dists/kali-bleeding-edge/main/binary-amd64/Packages' \
| awk -F ': ' '/^Package: /{print $2}' \
| wc -l
78
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ curl -s -L 'http://http.kali.org/kali/dists/kali-experimental/main/binary-amd64/Packages' \
| awk -F ': ' '/^Package: /{print $2}' \
| wc -l
192
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ curl -s -L 'http://http.kali.org/kali/dists/kali-rolling/main/binary-amd64/Packages' \
| awk -F ': ' '/^Package: /{print $2}' \
| wc -l
59518
kali@kali:~$
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The numbers will only grow bigger and better as time goes on, with less bugs in the code and more unit tests in place!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are a tool author and want to get your software on the list, please &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/">chat to us&lt;/a>, and we can show how to &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/leveraging-the-kali-bot/">enable webhooks&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="disabled-privileged-ports">Disabled Privileged Ports&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have patched &lt;strong>our kernel to remove the restriction&lt;/strong> of requiring privilege permission in order to use &lt;strong>TCP &amp;amp; UDP ports under 1024&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(meaning 0/TCP-UDP &amp;lt;= 1023/TCP-UDP)&lt;/em>. This was done because:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We see Kali as a &lt;strong>desktop OS&lt;/strong>, rather than a server&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This &amp;ldquo;well-known&amp;rdquo; privileged port range is reserved for &lt;strong>server services&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(e.g. 80/TCP HTTP, 443/TCP HTTPS)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>With the switch from Kali&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-default-non-root-user/">root to non-root user by default&lt;/a>, &lt;strong>rather than doing a port forward&lt;/strong> from outside the privilege ports to a restricted port, people were just &lt;strong>running the program with super-user permissions instead&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We get it. It&amp;rsquo;s quicker to run: &lt;code>$ sudo &amp;lt;program&amp;gt;&lt;/code>,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rather than remembering something like: &lt;code>$ sudo iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8888&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It also can get complex and confusing with a lot of redirects setup in place&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Alternatively people were using &lt;code>authbind&lt;/code> to allow certain users to use certain ports&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This &lt;strong>defeats the point of switching to non-root user&lt;/strong>!
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Let&amp;rsquo;s reduce any possible attack surface!&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, this change won&amp;rsquo;t appear in all instances as some flavors of Kali operate without our kernel. This depends on which platform you use &lt;em>(such as Cloud instances, Docker or WSL)&lt;/em>. If you are on a platform that does not use our customized Kernel, this change will not be applied. For example, the top one uses Kali&amp;rsquo;s kernel on a bare metal install, and below uses Kali in a docker container, so its using the host&amp;rsquo;s kernel:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ uname -r
5.10.0-kali7-amd64
kali@kali:~$
...vs...
$ docker run --rm --interactive --tty kalilinux/kali-rolling:latest uname -r
5.10.25-linuxkit
$
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>

&lt;p>It would not be a Kali release if there were not any new tools added! A quick run down of what&amp;rsquo;s been added &lt;em>(to Kali&amp;rsquo;s archive and network repositories)&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ghidra&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>VSCode&lt;/strong> have been included into the &lt;code>kali-linux-large&lt;/code> &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/">metapackage&lt;/a>, so they are &lt;strong>included on the installer image&lt;/strong> for people doing a fresh install. Otherwise you will need to upgrade Kali &lt;em>(if you already have the &lt;strong>kali-linux-large&lt;/strong> install)&lt;/em> or manually install them &lt;em>(if you want them!)&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt install -y ghidra code-oss
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>A few notes about &lt;code>code-oss&lt;/code> &lt;em>(aka &lt;strong>VSCode&lt;/strong>)&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We are &lt;strong>compiling this from &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/code-oss">source&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>, rather than using the pre-built binaries
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The upside to this is that &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry">&lt;strong>telemetry data is disabled&lt;/strong> by default&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The downside is that &lt;strong>some aspects of the marketplace may not work&lt;/strong>. If you find these limitations a problem, you may wish to uninstall the Kali package and switch to the VSCode pre-built binaries&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You also may question &lt;strong>why it was named &lt;code>code-oss&lt;/code>&lt;/strong>, rather than &lt;code>code&lt;/code>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Code-OSS is what the &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/8f11975c47c9d97b3248e14caf9f7bc4c372d84f/src/vs/platform/product/common/product.ts#L60">source-code&lt;/a> &lt;strong>calls &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/8f11975c47c9d97b3248e14caf9f7bc4c372d84f/product.json#L4">itself&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>, which is used as the base before the configurations are applied for the pre-compiled binaries that gets distributed as &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As we are using the source-code, we used the variables defined by it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>two different names help to distinguish the differences&lt;/strong> between them &lt;em>(also prevents any clashes and conflicts!)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We also &lt;strong>included various aliases in our package&lt;/strong> to help bridge between the two different versions. Meaning, calling &lt;strong>&lt;code>vscode&lt;/code> and &lt;code>code&lt;/code>&lt;/strong> will &lt;strong>use our package&lt;/strong>, &lt;code>code-oss&lt;/code>, with a friendly notice &lt;em>(when installed)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you already have the pre-compiled version installed, &lt;strong>upgrading Kali&lt;/strong> will &lt;strong>not replace it&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>However, when &lt;strong>manually installing&lt;/strong> &lt;code>code-oss&lt;/code>, it will then &lt;strong>replace&lt;/strong> it!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="theme-enhancement">Theme Enhancement&lt;/h2>
&lt;h4 id="command-line">Command Line&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>If you are using ZSH, with the latest Kali profile applied, you can &lt;strong>toggle between the two-line prompt and one-line prompt&lt;/strong> by pressing: &lt;strong>&lt;code>CTRL&lt;/code> + &lt;code>p&lt;/code>&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(at the same time)&lt;/em>.
This will only have an effect for the &lt;strong>current session&lt;/strong>. If you would like to set it &lt;strong>permanently, see &lt;code>kali-tweaks&lt;/code>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We have switched up the &lt;strong>quick launch tray&lt;/strong> in the top left, by:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dropping the &lt;strong>screen recorder&lt;/strong> button &lt;em>(as a result package can also be removed, &lt;code>kazam&lt;/code>)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adding a &lt;strong>text editor&lt;/strong> shortcut (this uses &lt;code>mousepad&lt;/code> as it is a quick and light)_
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>If you are looking for something that is more substantial, try &lt;code>code-oss&lt;/code>&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adding in a &lt;strong>web browser&lt;/strong> icon, which starts the default browser &lt;em>(often &lt;code>FireFox&lt;/code>)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adding a drop-down menu to select the &lt;strong>user for default terminal&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(&lt;code>terminal&lt;/code> or &lt;code>root terminal&lt;/code> &amp;amp; Kali&amp;rsquo;s default is &lt;code>QTerminal&lt;/code>)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Inside of &lt;code>Thunar&lt;/code> &lt;em>(Xfce&amp;rsquo;s default &lt;strong>file manager&lt;/strong>)&lt;/em>, if you right-click in the main window, you should have a new option, &lt;strong>Open as Root&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>With these theme changes, you &lt;strong>may not get them if you upgrade&lt;/strong> Kali. This is because the &lt;strong>theme settings&lt;/strong> are &lt;strong>copied&lt;/strong> to your &lt;strong>home folder&lt;/strong> when your &lt;strong>user is first created&lt;/strong>. When you upgrade Kali, it is &lt;strong>upgrading the operating system&lt;/strong>, so upgrading &lt;strong>does not alter personal files&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(just system files)&lt;/em>. As a result, in order to get these theme tweaks, you need to either:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do a fresh Kali install&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a new user and switch to that&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Delete your Xfce profile for the current user and force reboot&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ mv ~/.config/xfce4{,-$(date +%Y.%m.%d-%H.%M.%S)}

&lt;h4 id="desktop-wallpaper--login-background">Desktop Wallpaper &amp;amp; Login Background&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>People who have upgraded, you may have spotted that there is a new &lt;strong>default login wallpaper and desktop background&lt;/strong>, but there are extras as well in this release:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- If you are reading this, personally dig the ASCII one! -->
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-2-release/images/wallpapers.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whilst on the subject of wallpapers, if you have not noticed, previously we had been operating on an refresh cycle about &lt;strong>every 6 months&lt;/strong>, where we would change the default login and desktop as well as included other art work if they were not to your taste. Going forwards, we are aiming to &lt;strong>change the defaults at every 20xx.1 release&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(meaning it happens right at the start of every year)&lt;/em>. &lt;em>So it will still change again in 6 months, but this will be the last time!&lt;/em> We will still aim to &lt;strong>add extra wallpapers every 6 months&lt;/strong>, however, only &lt;strong>change the defaults yearly&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we have updated &lt;code>kali-community-wallpapers&lt;/code> &amp;amp; &lt;code>kali-wallpapers-legacy&lt;/code> packages as well!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="raspberry-pi-recharged">Raspberry Pi Recharged&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Two new packages:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://pkg.kali.org/pkg/kalipi-config">kalipi-config&lt;/a> - &lt;strong>&lt;code>raspi-config&lt;/code> on steroids&lt;/strong> to assist in the initial setup of Kali Linux on a Raspberry Pi&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://pkg.kali.org/pkg/kalipi-tft-config">kalipi-tft-config&lt;/a>- assist in the &lt;strong>initial setup of TFT displays&lt;/strong> on a Raspberry Pi&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And other improvements:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Got built-in Bluetooth working on Raspberry Pi 4 &amp;amp; Raspberry Pi 400 &lt;em>(meaning &lt;strong>all Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s built-in bluetooth work&lt;/strong>!)&lt;/em>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>This is due to &lt;code>bluez&lt;/code>, &lt;code>bluez-firmware&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>pi-bluetooth&lt;/code> packages forked and patched&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Raspberry Pi kernel updated to &lt;strong>5.4.83&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>mt76 devices&lt;/strong> now work on Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 if you pass the option &lt;code>disable_usb_sg=1&lt;/code> when loading the &lt;code>mt76_usb&lt;/code> module&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>1500%&lt;/strong> performance improvement&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First boot from &lt;strong>20 minutes to 15 seconds&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Console scrolling&lt;/strong> working&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="kali-nethunter-updates">Kali NetHunter Updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Plenty of improvements under the hood, including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Improved compatibility with &lt;strong>dynamic partitions&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improvements to persistence of &lt;strong>Magisk root&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improvements to &lt;strong>Bluetooth and settings menus&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Inclusion of &lt;code>rtl88xxau&lt;/code> &lt;strong>patches for older kernels&lt;/strong> in the kernel builder&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And the highlight:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Android 11&lt;/strong> support for:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Nokia 6.1&lt;/li>
&lt;li>OnePlus Nord&lt;/li>
&lt;li>OnePlus One&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Xiaomi Mi A3&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Xiaomi Poco F1&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The Kali NetHunter repository now contains &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://kalilinux.gitlab.io/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-devices/nethunter-kernelstats.html">179 kernels&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> for &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://kalilinux.gitlab.io/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-devices/nethunter-imagestats.html">72 devices&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>32 pre-built images&lt;/strong> are available on our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/kali-nethunter/">download page&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Huge thanks to &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kimoc0der">@kim0coder&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/yesimxev">@yesimxev&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/Svirusx">@Svirusx&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/Martinvlba">@Martinvlba&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/CaliBerrr">@CaliBerrr&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/maade69">@maade69&lt;/a> and the entire Kali NetHunter community for making this release happen. &lt;strong>You absolutely rock&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="more-docker-supportparallels-supportbug-fixes">More Docker support/Parallels support/Bug fixes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are even more improvements to Kali, that are outside of the above text. Below are other note-worthy items:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Our &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kalilinux/kali-rolling/tags">&lt;strong>Kali-Docker&lt;/strong> images&lt;/a> are now available for &lt;strong>arm64 and armhf&lt;/strong> as well as &lt;strong>amd64&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have patched &lt;code>pkexec&lt;/code>, so now &lt;strong>Qt applications&lt;/strong> which have been ran as &lt;strong>root&lt;/strong> will &lt;strong>maintain the dark theme and the HiDPI setting&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On a fresh Kali install, &lt;code>wireshark&lt;/code> can now be run by &lt;strong>unprivileged users&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A couple of &lt;strong>bugs were fixed in &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-1-release/">command-not-found&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>, which is the terminal helper that helps you installing missing programs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Accessibility features were not installed by default&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(this was a mistake on our side that is now fixed)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed a &lt;strong>terminal font issue with special characters&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Apple M1 users, &lt;a href="https://kb.parallels.com/en/124805">Parallels&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> is no longer in &amp;ldquo;Technical Preview&amp;rdquo; and as part of the release, they&amp;rsquo;ve fixed Kali image detection.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Win-KeX&lt;/code> v2.10 has been released which now &lt;strong>supports multiscreen&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kali&amp;rsquo;s logo is now included in the &lt;a href="https://www.nerdfonts.com/">nerd-fonts&lt;/a> project, so, with their next release you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to &lt;strong>customize your terminal with the dragon&lt;/strong>. If you want to try it now, we&amp;rsquo;ve created a &lt;a href="fonts/Fira-Code-Regular-Nerd-Font-Complete.ttf">patched Fira-Code font&lt;/a> with these new changes &lt;em>(the code for the logo is &lt;code>\uF32B&lt;/code>)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h2 id="download-kali-linux-20212">Download Kali Linux 2021.2&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fresh Images&lt;/strong>:
So what are you waiting for? Start &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/">grabbing Kali&lt;/a> already!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seasoned Kali Linux users are already aware of this, but for the ones who are not, we do also produce &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/">weekly builds&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> that you can use as well. If you cannot wait for our next release and you want the latest packages &lt;em>(or bug fixes)&lt;/em> when you download the image, you can just use the weekly image instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This way you&amp;rsquo;ll have fewer updates to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Just know that these are automated builds that we do not QA like we do our standard &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/releases/">release images&lt;/a>&lt;/em>. But we gladly take &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">bug reports&lt;/a> about those images because we want any issues to be fixed before our next release!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Existing Installs&lt;/strong>:
If you already have an existing Kali Linux installation, remember you can always do a quick &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/">update&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ echo &amp;quot;deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib&amp;quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt -y full-upgrade
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ for x in xfce4 qterminal.org qt5ct Thunar; do mv ~/.config/$x{,-$(date +%Y.%m.%d-%H.%M.%S)}; done
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ cp -rbi /etc/skel/. ~
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ sudo reboot -f
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You should now be on Kali Linux 2021.2. We can do a quick check by doing:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ grep VERSION /etc/os-release
VERSION=&amp;quot;2021.2&amp;quot;
VERSION_ID=&amp;quot;2021.2&amp;quot;
VERSION_CODENAME=&amp;quot;kali-rolling&amp;quot;
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ uname -v

âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ uname -r

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;em>NOTE: The output of &lt;code>uname -r&lt;/code> may be different depending on the system &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/linux">architecture&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As always, should you come across any bugs in Kali, please submit a report on our &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">bug tracker&lt;/a>. &lt;em>We&amp;rsquo;ll never be able to fix what we do not know is broken!&lt;/em> &lt;strong>And &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kalilinux">Twitter&lt;/a> is not a Bug Tracker!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kaboxer - Kali Applications Boxer</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/introducing-kaboxer/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/introducing-kaboxer/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/introducing-kaboxer/images/kaboxer-banner-v1.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>On and off for the last 18 months we have been working on &lt;strong>Kaboxer&lt;/strong>, and just before Kali 2021.1, it is ready to say &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; &lt;em>(then it will start shipping you applications)&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tldr---what-is-this">TL;DR - What is this?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What is the name about, Kaboxer?&lt;/strong> Kali Applications Boxer&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What does that mean?&lt;/strong> Apps in containers, for packages (a way forward for applications that are hard to package properly). But instead of being stand alone containers, they are integrated into the standard Kali package management systems and can be installed/removed through standard apt commands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Okay. But what does Kaboxer do?&lt;/strong> Not every tool is easy to package. There are various criteria to meet, at times some crazy dependency trees or peculiar system modifications. You may need to use a legacy library, or you may need to change a configuration of something that would break another application. What do you do? We work with tool authors to try and make it easier, or we spend many late nights trying to get it to fit or we are just unable to package it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter Kaboxer. Using containers we can put in complex non-standard package into a container and integrate it with the rest of the operating system, and bundle it up into the packaging eco-system. This means you can apt-install a Kaboxer program and use it without needing to take any special steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How does Kaboxer benefit me?&lt;/strong> Kaboxer has a few use-cases, depending on who is using it:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For people using Kali Linux, it is transparent so you will not notice when you are using it &lt;em>(which is why you may not see it as &amp;ldquo;a big deal&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/em>. You just get more tools!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For us Kali developers, this is a game changer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For other Debian packagers, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/packaging-apps-with-kaboxer/">this may pique your attention&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For tool authors &lt;em>(who want their software in Kali)&lt;/em>, there is hope for you yet ;-)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What&amp;rsquo;s the down side to Kaboxer?&lt;/strong> The size of the application will be larger because it will carry the normal overhead of having to use containers. While the installed package will be small, its installation will download the required container which will consume up to several hundreds of megabytes even for a simple application.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What is going to happen because of Kaboxer?&lt;/strong> We hope to start to include more tools into Kali Linux that were previously not packable, and have you not realize that you are using them via Kaboxer. Unfortunately, such tools will not make it into our default installation as the size increase for the ISO images would be too significant.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are various tools which would be a benefit to Kali users, but suffer from problems that make them hard to ship properly as &lt;code>*.deb&lt;/code> packages. This could be because, the tools:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Are not developed with packaging and system integration in mind. They assume they can install specific versions of libraries, or patch libraries, or download pieces of software at runtime rather than at install time. This is against packaging standards and also is bad software engineering practice.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>May feel they are entitled to do whatever they please with the operating system or other applications. These actions should not be allowed and the software needs to be isolated. We have seen actions such as:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Creating users with specific UIDs/GIDs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using paths that go against the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using TCP or UDP ports that are usually affected to other services.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reconfiguring existing services.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Interact with external servers (maybe by a insecure method), thus the software itself cannot be fully trusted. As a result, it may be a good idea to isolate such software from valuable or sensitive data that may be present on the system.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A way to provide the isolation required from above would be to use containerization. Containers allow running an application in an isolated environment, with drastically reduced risks of unplanned interaction with the rest of the system (users, services, other applications, existing files, specific versions of libraries, etc.).&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="design-choices">Design choices&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While we are not excluding to support other containerization solutions, we have opted to start with Docker. It is well-known, widely used, and benefits from a large eco-system of images, thus ensuring its long term viability. Docker containers can be configured in many ways to achieve the various integrations that we need with the host system or even between multiple containers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The value of Kaboxer is in how it makes it easy to tie together docker containers with the host system, through the usual docker features such as mount points and port redirections, but also through integration with desktop menu entries. All those integrations, as well as the instructions to build or retrieve the docker image, are specified in a single YAML file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is that single YAML file that is shipped in the &lt;code>.deb&lt;/code> files that we provide in Kali and the post installation script of those packages will transparently download the image so that the application is ready to run afterwards.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="build-of-docker-images">Build of Docker images&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The build of the docker images is also mediated by Kaboxer but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing magic, it boils down to calling &lt;code>docker build&lt;/code> on a specific &lt;code>Dockerfile&lt;/code> with a few variables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is up to the packager to write that Dockerfile but that step can be trivial when the upstream project already has a Dockerfile or when it provides a ready-to-use docker image.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="publication-of-docker-images">Publication of Docker images&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This step is so boring that we have automated it with GitLab CI. Every time that we make a change to a repository dedicated to a &amp;ldquo;kaboxed&amp;rdquo; application, such as covenant, &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/covenant-kbx/-/pipelines">GitLab CI&lt;/a> will rebuild the associated docker image and store it in its &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/covenant-kbx/container_registry">image registry&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="integration-of-the-images-into-the-system">Integration of the images into the system&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once the app is containerized, we still need to make it available to the user in a seamless way, in a manner that ideally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be noticeable. The user shouldn&amp;rsquo;t even have to know that the app runs in a container.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We already explained that users continue to interact with Kali packages to install and remove the containerized applications, even though those packages are mostly empty shells running Kaboxer commands in the various maintainer scripts. They do also provide &lt;code>.desktop&lt;/code> files so that the applications can be started from the usual desktop menu, and command-line helpers so that they can be started from a terminal without having to know about Kaboxer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be able to run docker containers, the users need some elevated permissions: we modified the Kali installer to grant those permissions by default to users created during the initial installation process. For other users, they will have to be added to the Kaboxer group (&lt;code>adduser $USER kaboxer&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Users obviously want their application data to be retained so Kaboxer has facilities to configure volumes shared between the host and the container thus providing persistence even if containers are short-lived. And then depending on the kind of application, you likely need more specific integrations:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For GUI applications, we need the host X11 socket to be accessible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For web applications, we want to expose the HTTP port and start the web browser on the appropriate URL.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Those basic needs are covered with the current Kaboxer features but it seems likely that other kind of integrations will be required in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If you still want to learn more about Kaboxer, please see its &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/tools/kaboxer/">homepage (plus source code)&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/packaging-apps-with-kaboxer/">our documentation (with &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; example)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For examples of &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; application, you can look at our first &amp;ldquo;Kaboxed apps&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/covenant-kbx/">Covenant&lt;/a>, a framework to highlight the attack surface of .NET. Covenant comes as a server that is started in the background, plus a Web app that runs in the browser.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/firefox-developer-edition-kbx">Firefox Developer Edition&lt;/a>, is a web browser and we picked it as it is a complex large GUI application.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/zenmap-kbx">Zenmap&lt;/a>, the official NMAP GUI. Zenmap relies on deprecated &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/python-2-end-of-life/">Python 2&lt;/a> libraries that are not available in Kali Linux.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Want to get your hands dirty and give it a try?&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt -y install covenant-kbx

&lt;p>&lt;em>Do not forget to open up &lt;code>https://localhost:7443&lt;/code> in a web browser!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you would like to start exploring Kaboxer itself and see what is happening under the hood:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ kaboxer
usage: kaboxer [-h] [-v] {run,start,stop,get-meta-file,get-upstream-version,prepare,upgrade,list,ls,build,install,clean,push,save,load,purge} ...

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Lastly, you can track what programs are using Kaboxer in Kali by searching packages ending with &lt;code>-kbx&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ apt-cache search --names-only '\-kbx$'

We were aware that our current ARM cloud provider was soon ending support for arm64 servers &lt;em>(which we use for our build daemons)&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/">Kali Linux&lt;/a>, one of the things which is important to us, is that we prefer not having to cross-compile our ARM binaries that we ship in our Kali packages. There are various reasons as to why, some of them are:&lt;/p>
&lt;!--
Tool count:
- https://pkg.kali.org/derivative/kali-roll/
- https://pkg.kali.org/teams/kali-developers/
- https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/ + archived
-->
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>With a huge list of packages, like the one we are maintaining &lt;em>(&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/policy/penetration-testing-tools-policy/">600+&lt;/a> at the time of writing)&lt;/em>, there will be a certain small percent that are not ready to be cross-compiled.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We want to be able to run the upstream test suites as part of the build, and in many case the testing software assumes that you can natively run the binaries that you just built.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We believe in &amp;ldquo;dogfooding&amp;rdquo; - we create an Operating System, that works on ARM. We want to use the OS, and the tools in it. We do this on &lt;strong>ARM systems for our day-to-day work&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We reached out to Ampere to see if they would be able to help us out. We soon realised they have the same mindset as we do, &lt;strong>ARM is the way forward&lt;/strong>. When developing Kali Linux, we treat &lt;strong>ARM devices as &amp;ldquo;first class citizens&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>, just like we do with our &amp;ldquo;desktop&amp;rdquo; images &lt;em>(amd64/i386)&lt;/em>. There are many advantages to ARM, such as using &lt;strong>less power&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(which means they don&amp;rsquo;t need cooling)&lt;/em>, &lt;strong>lighter&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(handy when traveling to be on site or mailing devices to be a drop box)&lt;/em> and &lt;strong>cheaper devices&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(client doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to return the device!)&lt;/em>. These make &lt;strong>really small form factor devices&lt;/strong> - which for doing penetration testing or red team exercises on site, expands the possibilities of where to hide various devices &lt;em>(imagination is the only limitation)&lt;/em>. This is why we try and give the same user experience regardless of the platform you are using Kali on.
&lt;em>This is why we have pre-generated images and build scripts for as many different devices as possible&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ampere has various community outreach programs, allowing as many different people as possible to interact with their hardware. The offerings are only expanding, and we now have a new permanent ARM home at &lt;a href="https://osuosl.org/">Oregon State University&amp;rsquo;s Open Source Lab&lt;/a> where we are building all of our ARM packages, with plans to move our ARM OS images to be built here too in the near future.&lt;/p>
&lt;!--
This isn't 100% true, as we only moved over arm64 to OSUOSL
Don't think it matter too much however.
-->
&lt;p>It is never a fun task having to re-build systems, but we have noticed a very large advantage of doing so. &lt;strong>There was a huge increase in performance from using Ampere&amp;rsquo;s hardware&lt;/strong>. The change of environment was &lt;strong>noticed straight away&lt;/strong>, without any changes to our configuration. Below is the first three packages we built and the time differences.&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Package&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Old (HH:MM:SS)&lt;/th>
&lt;th>New (HH:MM:SS)&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Difference (HH:MM:SS)&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Percent Improvement&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/linux">Linux Kernel&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>08:31:38&lt;/td>
&lt;td>03:09:40&lt;/td>
&lt;td>05:21:53&lt;/td>
&lt;td>269.75%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/metasploit-framework">Metasploit-Framework&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>00:18:00&lt;/td>
&lt;td>00:14:30&lt;/td>
&lt;td>00:03:30&lt;/td>
&lt;td>124.14%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/debian-installer">debian-installer&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>00:24:16&lt;/td>
&lt;td>00:14:53&lt;/td>
&lt;td>00:09:23&lt;/td>
&lt;td>163.05%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>The results speak for themselves. Every package is now &lt;strong>building drastically quicker&lt;/strong>. We also believe, with tweaking a few configuration we can gain &lt;strong>even more of a performance increase&lt;/strong>. This is only possible by the increased RAM offering with OSUOSL. This will allow for OverlayFS to be used with &lt;code>tmpfs&lt;/code> (RAM file system) which will seamlessly reduce having to access any disk drives.&lt;/p>
&lt;!--
When we shared the results to Ampere, they were impressed and happy to see such a large improvement. On the same call, they said to us "**we can do even better**!". They didn't want it to end there. They wanted to see how much more we could push it. As a result, they put us into their **early access program**, which gave us access to their **new upcoming cutting edge bare-metal hardware**, to repeat the test.
Insert results when we do them.
Should take us half a day to setup the build daemons - then its a case of waiting/forcing packages to be built &amp; waiting.
-->
&lt;p>We are very grateful for Ampere who are now powering our arm64/armhf/armel package build daemons. We will be moving over our ARM images building machine, as well as exploring the opportunity todo various other general services (e.g. web servers) to them given their performance. &lt;strong>We are delighted with the partnership. Thank you Ampere!&lt;/strong> This sort of partnership is what the open-source community is all about. And we are pleased as can be to have a partner like Ampere to rely on with such an important part of our build process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux 2021.1 Release (Command-Not-Found)</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-1-release/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-1-release/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-1-release/images/banner-2021.1-release.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>Today we&amp;rsquo;re pushing out the first Kali Linux &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/releases/">release&lt;/a> of the year with &lt;strong>Kali Linux 2021.1&lt;/strong>.

&lt;p>The summary of the &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/changelog_page.php">changelog&lt;/a> since the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-4-release/">2020.4 release from November 2020&lt;/a> is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-1-release/#xfce--kde-updates">Xfce 4.16&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - Our preferred and current default desktop environment has been updated and tweaked&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-1-release/#xfce--kde-updates">KDE 5.20&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - Plasma also received a version bump&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-1-release/#terminals-tweaks">Terminals&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - &lt;code>mate-terminal&lt;/code>, &lt;code>terminator&lt;/code> and &lt;code>tilix&lt;/code> all had various work carried out on them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-1-release/#finding-commands-that-didnt-want-to-be-found">Command Not Found&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - A helping hand to say if a program needs to be installed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-1-release/#partnerships-with-tools-authors">Partnership with more tool authors&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - BC Security &amp;amp; Joohoi have been producing great tools and we want to support them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-1-release/#new-tools-in-kali">New tools &amp;amp; updates&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - Multiple new tools have been added to Kali and are ready for you&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-1-release/#kali-nethunter-updates">Kali NetHunter&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - New BusyBox &amp;amp; Rucky version, and boot-animation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-1-release/#kali-arm-updates">Kali ARM&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - Preliminary support for Parallels on Apple Silicon (Apple M1) &amp;amp; Raspberry Pi 400 (WiFi Support)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The Kali project itself also has a couple different changes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-1-release/#kalis-website">New Kali website&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - You may have noticed a few things looking different&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/newsletter/">Kali newsletter&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - Rather than you coming to us for updates, we can push them to your inbox&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="xfce--kde-updates">Xfce &amp;amp; KDE Updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>How you choose to interact with Kali is completely up to you. You may want to access Kali locally or remotely, either graphically or on the command line. Even when you pick a method, there are still options you can choose from, such as a desktop environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By default, Kali uses &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/">Xfce&lt;/a>, but during the setup process, allows for GNOME, KDE, or no GUI to be selected. After the setup is complete, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/switching-desktop-environments/">you can install even more&lt;/a>. We have pre-configurations for Enlightenment, i3, LXDE, and MATE as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So when a desktop environment gets an update, they often enhance day-to-day activities for their users. It&amp;rsquo;s best to hear it straight from the authors, for a tour of what&amp;rsquo;s changed:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.xfce.org/about/tour416">Xfce 4.16&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.20.0/">KDE 5.20&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Below is our tweaked GTK3 theme, on Xfce:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-1-release/images/xfce-414-new.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="terminals-tweaks">Terminals Tweaks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When we use Kali, we spend a significant amount of time using the command line. A lot of the time, we do it using a local terminal &lt;em>(rather than in a console or remote SSH)&lt;/em>. With the options of desktop environments, there are also choices when it comes to the terminals &lt;em>(same with what shell to use)&lt;/em>. We have been working away on various terminals (&lt;code>xfce4-terminal&lt;/code>, &lt;code>tmux&lt;/code>, &lt;code>tilix&lt;/code>, &lt;code>konsole&lt;/code>, &lt;code>qterminal&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>mate-terminal&lt;/code>) to &amp;ldquo;Kali-fy&amp;rdquo; them:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-1-release/images/kali-terminals.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="finding-commands-that-didnt-want-to-be-found">Finding Commands That Didn&amp;rsquo;t Want To Be Found&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/major-metapackage-makeover/">A while ago&lt;/a>, we changed the &lt;strong>default set of tools installed&lt;/strong> in Kali. Most users know they can either install a one-off package, or revert back to the old set of defaults &lt;em>(&lt;code>apt install kali-linux-large&lt;/code>)&lt;/em>. But to help communicate our changes (as well as any new tools), we have now included &lt;code>command-not-found&lt;/code> by default. &lt;em>This is an &amp;ldquo;optional&amp;rdquo; package, which can be removed without removing all of &lt;code>kali-linux-default&lt;/code>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without &lt;code>command-not-found&lt;/code> installed:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ gitleaks
gitleaks: command not found
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If you are wondering &amp;ldquo;How does this help me?&amp;rdquo;, or has the above ever happened to you, we like to think people&amp;rsquo;s next stage would be to do &lt;code>apt-cache search gitleaks&lt;/code> and see it in the network repositories. But we can do better. Now with &lt;code>command-not-found&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ gitleaks
Command 'gitleaks' not found, but can be installed with:
sudo apt install gitleaks
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ gitleakss
Command 'gitleakss' not found, did you mean:
command 'gitleaks' from deb gitleaks
Try: sudo apt install &amp;lt;deb name&amp;gt;
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ badcmd
badcmd: command not found
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>As you can see from the above example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>gitleaks&lt;/code> - If the command you entered is the name of an executable available in Kali, it will say the package that you need to install &lt;em>(if its not already!)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>gitleakss&lt;/code> - If you are &amp;ldquo;fat fingered&amp;rdquo; and make a typo, it may make a suggestion&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>badcmd&lt;/code> - If you typed in an invalid command that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in Kali, it will give the original message of &amp;ldquo;command not found&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, how can I get this magic? Good question! If you&amp;rsquo;re:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Doing a fresh install of Kali Linux 2021.1 or later, it will &amp;ldquo;just happen&amp;rdquo; during the setup.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Updating Kali and you are using a Bash shell, then it will &amp;ldquo;just happen&amp;rdquo; too.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Updating Kali and you are using a Zsh shell, you will need to add the following lines to your &lt;code>~/.zshrc&lt;/code>:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh"># enable command-not-found if installed
if [ -f /etc/zsh_command_not_found ]; then
. /etc/zsh_command_not_found
fi
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to end here. By adding &lt;code>COMMAND_NOT_FOUND_INSTALL_PROMPT=1&lt;/code> to your shell&amp;rsquo;s environment &lt;em>(e.g. &lt;code>~/.bashrc&lt;/code> or &lt;code>~/.zshrc&lt;/code>)&lt;/em>, &lt;code>command-not-found&lt;/code> will take it one step further, and also prompt you if you want to install the missing package. &lt;em>This change is something we will be putting in in a future release.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope it helps!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="partnerships-with-tools-authors">Partnerships with Tools Authors&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Carrying on from our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-4-release/">previous partnership&lt;/a> with byt3bl33d3r, we have expanded to supporting:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/empire-starkiller/">BC Security&lt;/a> - Giving Kali exclusive early access to &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/powershell-empire">Empire&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; (&lt;code>powershell-empire&lt;/code>) &amp;amp; &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/starkiller">StarKiller&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The announcement with Joohoi is new for Kali 2021.1. Like the previous sponsorships, you can either &lt;a href="https://github.com/sponsors/joohoi">sponsor him directly&lt;/a> to get the latest access to ffuf, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/">use Kali Linux&lt;/a>, or wait 30 days until the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf">source code&lt;/a> becomes public. However, he has &lt;a href="https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf#access-the-sponsorware-through-code-contributions">also announced&lt;/a> anyone who makes a significant contribution, which gets accepted into the project, also gets access!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-tools-in-kali">New Tools in Kali&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a Kali release if there weren&amp;rsquo;t any new tools added! A quick run down of what&amp;rsquo;s been added &lt;em>(to the network repositories)&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/airgeddon">Airgeddon&lt;/a> - Audit wireless networks&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="kalis-website">Kali&amp;rsquo;s Website&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Until recently, the only way you could be reading this would have been from our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/rss.xml">RSS feed&lt;/a> or directly from our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/">blog&lt;/a> &lt;em>(as we only recently made the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-newsletter-keeping-in-touch/">announcement&lt;/a> of the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/newsletter/">Kali Newletter&lt;/a>)&lt;/em>. You may of noticed already, and &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/2019-2020-review-onwards-with-2021/">we said&lt;/a> that it was coming, and it finally has - &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/">kali.org&lt;/a> has had a face-lift!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have &lt;em>(finally)&lt;/em> moved away from WordPress to Hugo. Similarly to Kali, the website will also be a rolling distribution. The recent change is mostly cosmetic and content &lt;em>(both were long overdue)&lt;/em>, and we have made plans for new features to be added.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another upside of the switch is that we can take more advantage of what GitLab has to offer. We recently had &lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/02/18/kali-linux-movingtogitlab/">an interview with GitLab&lt;/a> about the switch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the subject of interviews, we also had a word with &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/mr-robot-arg-society/">Mr Robot&amp;rsquo;s ARG Society&lt;/a> if you missed that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wallpapers">Wallpapers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Just a quick little thing, we have tweaked our wallpaper packages:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>kali-wallpapers-2020.4&lt;/code> - Kali&amp;rsquo;s wallpapers from 2020.4 and onwards &lt;em>(for the time being)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>kali-wallpapers-2019.4&lt;/code> - Kali&amp;rsquo;s wallpapers between 2019.4 and 2020.3.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>kali-wallpapers-legacy&lt;/code> - BackTrack &amp;amp; Kali nostalgic backgrounds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>kali-wallpapers-all&lt;/code> - Every wallpaper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>kali-community-wallpapers&lt;/code> - created and submitted by the community &lt;em>(&lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/kali-community-wallpapers/-/merge_requests">submit yours&lt;/a> today!)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>With the alterations to the packages, we have taken the time to improve support for Xfce when using them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enjoy!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-nethunter-updates">Kali NetHunter Updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>BusyBox, one of the core engines of Kali NetHunter, has received a well deserved upgrade to version &amp;ldquo;1.32.0-nethunter&amp;rdquo;. BusyBox is used internally to ensure that NetHunter tools and commands are executed consistently across the vast number of different Android versions and vendor modifications. This change, whilst big, should go unnoticed by users and will help developers to port their code to NetHunter with no hassles at all. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yesimxev">@yesimxev&lt;/a> has added a handy section to the settings menu, which allows developers to select different BusyBox versions for testing:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-1-release/images/BusyBoxSelector.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking of developers: If you have any cool ideas you&amp;rsquo;d like to see included in Kali NetHunter or if you would like to contribute to this amazing project, please reach out to us in our &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/">forums&lt;/a> or on &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter">GitLab&lt;/a>. We would love to hear from you!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tools have been updated to the latest versions, notably Rucky - the &amp;ldquo;modern looking USB Rubber Ducky Editor and Attack Launcher&amp;rdquo;, which has been completely re-written by its author &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mayank_metha">@mayankmetha&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://staging.nethunter.com/en/packages/com.mayank.rucky/">released in the Kali NetHunter App Store as version 2.1&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve also been busy working on the visual aspects of Kali NetHunter, with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thiviyann">@s133py&lt;/a> adding a stunning new boot-animation to the growing selection:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2021-1-release/images/res_raw_boot_glitch.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have a cool boot-animation youâd like to share, please submit a merge request to our &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/apps/kali-nethunter-bootanimation">Kali NetHunter boot-animation repository&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-arm-updates">Kali ARM Updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As you may have heard, Apple have released new Macs with their own processors, known as Apple Silicon &lt;em>(Apple M1)&lt;/em>. So far, only Parallels have released something publicly that people can use for virtualization. To that end, we have generated both an installer &amp;amp; live ISOs (&lt;code>kali-linux-2021.1-installer-arm64.iso&lt;/code> and &lt;code>kali-linux-2021.1-live-arm64.iso&lt;/code>) that can be used with VMs on Apple Silicon Macs. Many thanks to the people who reached out and offered to test and helped us to iron out the bugs. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to see it in action, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidbombal">David Bombal&lt;/a> has put out a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBzKDF67eWY">video&lt;/a> of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have also added support for the Raspberry Pi 400&amp;rsquo;s wireless card, however it is very important to note that this is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> a &lt;a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon">nexmon&lt;/a> firmware, as nexmon does not currently support it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm/">Kali ARM build scripts&lt;/a> have seen a few more improvements from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/frangalinux">Francisco Jose Rodriguez Martos&lt;/a> and we appreciate the assistance greatly. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to get involved with ARM, check out the &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm/-/issues">GitLab issue list&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="download-kali-linux-20211">Download Kali Linux 2021.1&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fresh Images&lt;/strong>:
So what are you waiting for? Start &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">downloading&lt;/a> already!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seasoned Kali Linux users are already aware of this, but for the ones who are not, we do also produce &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/">weekly builds&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> that you can use as well. If you cannot wait for our next release and you want the latest packages &lt;em>(or bug fixes)&lt;/em> when you download the image, you can just use the weekly image instead.
This way you&amp;rsquo;ll have fewer updates to do.
&lt;em>Just know that these are automated builds that we do not QA like we do our standard &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/releases/">release images&lt;/a>&lt;/em>. But we gladly take &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">bug reports&lt;/a> about those images because we want any issues to be fixed before our next release!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Existing Installs&lt;/strong>:
If you already have an existing Kali Linux installation, remember you can always do a quick &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/">update&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ echo &amp;quot;deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib&amp;quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt -y full-upgrade
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo reboot -f
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You should now be on Kali Linux 2021.1. We can do a quick check by doing:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ grep VERSION /etc/os-release

One of the key components to Kali is the tools included &lt;em>(either pre-installed or installed via apt)&lt;/em>. Joining together infosec professional/hobbyist and tool authors, today we are announcing another partnership: &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.bc-security.org/post/kali-and-bc-security-partnership">Kali has partnered with BC Security&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BC Security is the team who is currently maintaining the most active fork of &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/powershell-empire">Empire&lt;/a>. In August 2019, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xorrior/status/1156626181107736576">original maintainers&lt;/a> archived the project, but with Open-source projects &lt;em>(as long as they don&amp;rsquo;t break software licenses&lt;/em>) other groups can take someone else&amp;rsquo;s code and improve upon it. This is exactly what BC Security did, forking the project, to keep the flame of &lt;a href="https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire">PowerShell Empire&lt;/a> alive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Empire is a post-exploitation framework, which its agents supporting various different Operating Systems (OS). Windows is purely implemented in PowerShell &lt;em>(without &lt;code>powershell.exe&lt;/code>!)&lt;/em>, and Linux/macOS is done in Python 3. Feature rich with various options to bypass various protections &lt;em>(and allows for easy modification for custom evasion)&lt;/em>, Empire is often a favourite for Command and Control (C2) activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We first had interaction with BC Security, when they were porting over the original Empire code base (v2.5) from Python 2 to 3 &lt;em>(as v2 had reached &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/python-2-end-of-life/">End of Life&lt;/a> in January 2020)&lt;/em>. This is to help ensure Empire is is up-to-date and relevant with the modern software stack. They have also put in the time to increase empires features &lt;em>(growing on the original authors, that malware can be in PowerShell format)&lt;/em>. BC Security also have created their own &amp;ldquo;Graphical User Interface (GUI)&amp;rdquo;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Starkiller">Starkiller&lt;/a>, to go along side Empire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Under their sponsorware model, in order to get the latest version of Empire &amp;amp; Starkiller, you can &lt;a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BC-SECURITY">sponsor&lt;/a> to get the latest access, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/">use Kali Linux&lt;/a>, or wait 30 days until the &lt;a href="https://github.com/BC-SECURITY">source code becomes public&lt;/a>. We believe the partnership will aid development of the tool &lt;em>(who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want new features!)&lt;/em>, but at the same time allowing access to it for as many people as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the announcement of the partnership, there are new versions being released:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Empire has reached v3.7&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Starkiller is now at v1.6&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For more information about the changelog and their views, you can read about on &lt;a href="https://www.bc-security.org/post/kali-and-bc-security-partnership">their blog&lt;/a>. Afterwards give Empire a try &lt;em>if you&amp;rsquo;re &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">using Kali Linux&lt;/a>!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]

But there is a little bit more that we have not talked about due to NDAs. But it appears the mystery is over, the red tape has been removed, and we now wanted to take a moment to share it with everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had a relationship with Mr Robot, which started during the filming of the 2nd season. While the 1st season was running, we were approached at BlackHat 2015 to give our permission to use Kali in the show. We worked out the legal parts of things (it&amp;rsquo;s legal to use Kali in media, we don&amp;rsquo;t care, but studios want that in writing), and starting in the 2nd season from time to time the production staff would reach out to us to ask us questions, have us provide them graphics, provide them with specific versions of Kali that were public on specific dates, and similar to keep the show accurate. We were very impressed with the efforts to keep the show grounded while still carrying on a strong hacking focused narrative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mr Robot has an &amp;ldquo;Alternative Reality Game (ARG)&amp;rdquo; that has been part of the show from the &lt;a href="https://wiki.gamedetectives.net/index.php?title=Mr._Robot_ARG">start&lt;/a>. The idea is that as you watch the show, you watch for clues and the clues from the show go into the game and you solve puzzles etc. The production staff wanted us to be part of this ARG and help them on their final step of the puzzle to be tied into the last episode. The final episode aired December 2019, but the puzzle was only recently finally solved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can read the gory details of the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARGsociety/wiki/index#wiki_post_season_4_.2F_series">final answer&lt;/a> if you are interested. The idea was, we would do a commit to the Kali Git repository that would include a number of items, but also have a surprise. The commit we made was the initial commit of the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/kali-legacy-wallpapers">Legacy Wallpapers&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; where we took the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/introduction/kali-linux-history/">old Kali&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.backtrack-linux.org/">BackTrack&lt;/a> wallpapers and made them available to everyone. However, &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/kali-legacy-wallpapers/blob/kali/master/kali-1.1/kali-1.1-1280x1024.jpg/">embedded in one of the images&lt;/a> was a steganographic message which was a private SSH key. This is the same background image that was used throughout the show&amp;rsquo;s filming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With a password, the SSH key could be extracted from that image. Then with that, players of the ARG could use it to connect to a &amp;ldquo;final target&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How would anyone find that one graphic? The clues in the ARG that lead them to it included a call out to &amp;ldquo;Offensive Security&amp;rdquo;, the Kali GitLab group ID, the project ID for the Legacy Wallpapers, and the specific commit where we had uploaded the special wallpaper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now the mystery is over, the final problem is solved, and the last door on Mr Robot is finally closed. It was awesome being even a small part of the show, and we loved the respect that the show paid to keeping everything based in reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Goodbye friend.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="mr-robot-arg-society">Mr. Robot ARG Society&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Any show would be nothing without an audience to watch it. Mr Robot is no exception, and after millions of people watched it, communities started to formed (either online or in person). People would discuss previous episodes, predict theories of where the show was going to go, and have watching parties. Its not un-common for shows to have &amp;ldquo;Easter eggs&amp;rdquo; embedded in them (these can be are little gems hidden in plain sight, which may give a &amp;ldquo;head nod&amp;rdquo; to something, or a spoiler for a up coming event). They are hunted after by people, and adds another level of excitement to re-watch a show. Mr Robot has plenty of them. But where Mr Robot is unique to any other show out, there is &lt;em>(for the time being)&lt;/em> an various online elements which links beautifully back into the show. In a sense, these are mini &amp;ldquo;spin offs&amp;rdquo; to the show, allowing for people to go further, get interactive and solve challenges in the Mr Robot universe. One &lt;em>(of a few)&lt;/em> domains is &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.whoismrrobot.com/">Who Is Mr Robot&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, which is where there was a lot of focus to solve its challenge(&lt;strong>s&lt;/strong>). This was made up of a collection of virtual terminals all from the show, which has a series of technical challenges to solve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were multiple groups of people working towards &lt;em>(either group of friends doing it privately, or people who started out to be strangers coming together doing it publicly)&lt;/em>, a lot of people started trying to answer, but not many made it all the way to the end of Season 4. Finally after over a year of trying, someone got the final part, ARGSociety. We want to reach out and get their view of the show &amp;amp; challenges. We found their &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARGsociety/">subreddit&lt;/a> and later joined their &lt;a href="https://discord.com/invite/2ERCJa2">discord&lt;/a>. It was immediately apparent how close of a community these people are, not only how active but how passionate they are about the show (and still are). People didn&amp;rsquo;t know each other before joining, but they were all welcoming, humble, and they all had a part to play in solving the puzzle. After chatting to everyone one of the members, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/B4815162342K">@BK&lt;/a>, was selected to be in interviewed on behalf of everyone in the group.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) Why the show Mr Robot?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Mr Robot shouted out to the world: I am here now, and &amp;ldquo;your democracy has been hacked&amp;rdquo;. The premise was enough to make me curious. Myself and the other leaders of this crazy community (Carnage Beam and Risk), had no clue what any of us were about to get into.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) Did you start watching it from the start?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even seen so much as a trailer for this show when I started it. Aside from a poster of this dude in a hoodie, I went in blind. But USA network allowed the pilot episode to be viewed about a month or so earlier than its on air premiere date. So by the time the pilot had aired, I think I had already rewatched that single episode 4 or 5 times.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) What was your favorite season from the TV show?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Picking a favorite season of Mr Robot is like trying to pick a favorite family member. I love them all in their own unique ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Season 1 offered us a hacking adventure show, almost fit with our very own &amp;ldquo;hack of the week&amp;rdquo; (usually a procedural trope I mostly loath). And as someone who wasn&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the hacking world, I walked into Mr Robot season 1 as an undergrad and by episode 10, I felt like I had my degree. At the same time it became evident as each episode aired, that this was so much more than a hack of the week show. It was the character driven drama that kept me week to week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Season 2 became a mirror into the soul; Elliot&amp;rsquo;s soul, and ours. It was slower paced, and with Elliot unable to hack for about half the season, Esmail was able to take deep dives into his characters' minds. Season 2 was polarizing, but for those that stuck with it, perhaps the most rewarding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Season 3 became this high octane combination of season 1 and 2. We stood and watched as we got hacks, evil antagonists with master plans, all the tears, and most importantly, we got deeper into the psychology of Elliot Alderson. As Elliot hacked his way through season 3, we learned more and more about who this Elliot guy really was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then Sam delivered season 4. Fulfilling a show long promise that we the audience would finally understand the &amp;ldquo;whys&amp;rdquo; for everything that had transpired on the show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How could I ever pick one member of the family over another?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) Did you watch the show by yourself or with people in the same room or virtually?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I had broken my foot and was subsequently dumped that same summer Mr Robot first aired. So for season 1, I was watching alone in a bed with my leg in a boot (I honestly think Sam Esmail would agree this method of watching helped me live inside Elliot&amp;rsquo;s brain a bit more). At the time, I browsed Reddit for other shows I watched like &amp;ldquo;The Leftovers&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;LOST&amp;rdquo;. And I found the Mr Robot subreddit sometime in the middle of that summer. It&amp;rsquo;s where I first learned people were catching background items in the show that I had seen as well and trying to group think just what those items may mean overall. I was hooked.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) Hacking is such a boring thing to watch, how did the shot make it interesting to you?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This, I thought, would be the easiest question to answer. Because I do represent that part of the audience that has NO CLUE how to hack. It&amp;rsquo;s foreign to me in every way. Yet there I was week after week, trying to understand more and more of just how Elliot could pull some of these hacks off. There are three different types of viewers out there: Those who can hack, those who cant but understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on, and those who don&amp;rsquo;t know how to use hotkeys. I was the latter. I think the most important thing Esmail did for the hacking world and how it is represented on TV was&amp;ndash;he didn&amp;rsquo;t sugar coat anything. He showed us EXACTLY what hacking was. No TRON city file directories in this show. He didn&amp;rsquo;t need to spice up or dumb down what hacking was to deliver it to his audience&amp;ndash;no need. The respect he showed carried over to me as an ignorant audience member.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite hack from the show?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My favorite hack was one of the more simple in all of the show&amp;rsquo;s hacks (rich coming from someone who cant hack to call anything done in this show simple). There&amp;rsquo;s a moment at the end of season 1 (I won&amp;rsquo;t spoil it in case some people have been living under a rock) where Elliot needs to hack a blank CD with audio files. This rudimentary hack was shot beautifully with Rami&amp;rsquo;s amazing acting center stage. Then the music kicks into high gear as we are with Elliot in the moment. He cried&amp;ndash;we all cried. It was this moment near the end of season 1&amp;ndash;I realized this show was gonna change things about TV.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) Would you call yourself a hacker (pre or post show)? What do you do for your day job?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I would not call myself a hacker. I think every single person in the Mr Robot ARG community would attest that I was the quintessential non-hacker of the community. Carnage Beam and Risk on the other hand were our experts, in addition to being part of the leadership team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the show started I was still in professional sports advertising. By the time the show ended, I moved back to Los Angeles to be a writer.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) Had you used Kali Linux before?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I hadn&amp;rsquo;t so much as heard of Kali Linux, let alone used it prior to Mr Robot.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) What did you think of the ending?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is like kicking a hornet&amp;rsquo;s nest. I loved the ending. I hated the ending. And then I loved it all over again. Endings are damn near impossible these days. Writing a mystery? Groupthink from Reddit most likely already figured it out 8 episodes ago. Writing an epic adventure? Better not have one of your big bads die with a glass of wine in their hand staring off in the distance. What Sam did in the final season was almost take the onus off the &amp;ldquo;ending&amp;rdquo;. He gave us answers throughout that final season, allowing us to just enjoy the final chapter of the story as best we could knowing it was all coming to an end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something the end of Mr robot captured was spirit. As Elliot&amp;rsquo;s journey was ending, ours was too. Despite all the crazy hacks, storylines and complex problems Elliot got himself into, most of all we all just wanted to see this crazy hacker find peace. I think Sam accomplished that with flying colors.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) How many times have you seen the show now?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Well you&amp;rsquo;re talking to a member of ARGsociety. I think the average member has rewatched each season at least 2 or 3 times. Personally I have seen each season anywhere from 15-20 times. I am a theorizer. A graduate with a PhD from the theory school of LOST. If the show really has meat on the bones, you&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself learning or catching something new each watch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now add in the puzzles. Scanning episodes over and over and over again, scrupulously looking for easter eggs or QR codes. Or looking for that one item Sam placed in the background to be found only upon a rewatch.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) Aware of any other easter eggs in the show?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Well, that was the beauty of this show. It demanded we look at, and question, everything. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we did. The line blurred so much it was hard to tell what was an actual easter egg and what wasn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fun fact, Sam said there&amp;rsquo;s still an easter egg or two to be found from the show. Granted we may have already found whatever he&amp;rsquo;s talking about, or maybe not&amp;hellip; but I think there will always be a mystery or two left to be solved in Mr Robot.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) When did you start to partake in solving the puzzle (WHoIsMrRobot.com)?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>After the CD hack at the end of season 1. Seeing as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a hacker, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what it was I was actually seeing on screen in terms of interactive ARG material. It took watching Elliot do something as innocuous as the CD hack for me to wonder &amp;ldquo;hey what was that password he used? Am I supposed to figure it out?&amp;rdquo; I jumped on Reddit and found our group, ARGsociety, still in its infancy. Leading me to the infamous wimr (whoismrrobot.com).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) Can you explain what it was like when you solved any part of the challenges?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If I pretended to answer this like I myself solved any part of the puzzle, our community of thousands would collectively laugh their butt off. I helped when I could, but most of our solves were figured out together. We painstakingly would discuss what and where answers could be found. Fellow leadership would try and explain the fundamentals of different ciphers and how to spot them, in an effort to advance in the game. But this group of puzzle solvers was never satisfied until we beat each season as a whole. We never celebrated (or slept) until every single puzzle was solved and the story for that season&amp;rsquo;s ARG was complete.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) What was your favorite part of the interactive puzzle?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Personally for me, it was the world blending. According to the show we, the audience, were inside the mind of Elliot. The interactive ARG websites helped cement that notion. It felt like we were really living in Elliot&amp;rsquo;s universe with every URL or QR code we would find.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) Would you partake in solving another show&amp;rsquo;s interactive puzzle?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I would in principle. However it would need the perfect blend that Mr Robot provided. There&amp;rsquo;s a fine line between marketing material, simple interactive game, and world blending ARG. Other shows have tried to pass off superfluous marketing material as some kind of makeshift ARG and they&amp;rsquo;d lose me, Carnage, Beam, and Risk off the bat. In fact that kind of laziness in the world building would make me stop watching the show altogether. A few shows can get it half right and really do put time and effort into their ARG&amp;ndash;but there&amp;rsquo;s no world blending. It just feels like you&amp;rsquo;re solving a game that has no bearing on the actual substance of the show you&amp;rsquo;re watching. Mr Robot captured the exact right amount of magic to make their ARG blossom.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) What advice would you give to a TV show/movie producer who is wanting to create an interactive &amp;ldquo;puzzle&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Almost a see above answer here. I would repeat what I heard Sam Esmail say about his ARG: &amp;ldquo;If we&amp;rsquo;re gonna do this&amp;ndash;we do it 100%&amp;rdquo;. Don&amp;rsquo;t half ass it. There is a unique opportunity for show creators and producers by developing an ARG world, one that I think a lot have shied away from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On that token, I would also say Esmail could have done even more. To be clear: he gave us this game and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more grateful. He melded us into his universe with precision&amp;ndash;he knowingly or unknowingly created a community of die hard fans for life. Ones that were hopping back to Amazon prime to rewatch an episode because they&amp;rsquo;re looking for 2 more digits to an IP address they missed. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take a genius to know what that can mean for view counts, strategic advertising, and word of mouth. But by the end of the show, we kind of did feel left out in the dust a bit. 1000s of hours were invested into his universe, and I dare say we would all do it again in a heartbeat. But it felt like we were pen pals waiting for a letter that never came. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a slight against Sam or the larger audience as a whole. But there was only one group of a few thousand people walking, talking, sleeping, and breathing Mr Robot&amp;ndash;that was ARGsociety. I know that when I write a TV show, those are the fans I&amp;rsquo;ll be giving back to the most.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) What are you going to do now? After rewatching the show another time that is!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m going to continue to write my ass off until I feel like I somehow know what I am doing. Kind of like how I handled hacking and the ARG for Mr Robot! Then the next step is figuring out how to incorporate an ARG of my own into a show I have cooking up.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) At what stage did you create the community?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We began as a subreddit. I joined leadership at that stage&amp;ndash;right around the start of 2017. We also had an IRC where we would try and chat in real time but it was never too effective in communication. We hit about 3 or 4 thousand members on the Reddit (most of which active) before we ballooned, prior to season 3. Each seasons' ARG came with a prize. And the prize for solving season 2&amp;ndash;was that your name would be put into the show on one of the many hacking screens we see. Some of us were lucky enough to be included in the Mr Robot universe for life&amp;ndash;a prize no one can ever take away. A true honor. So once word of this very interactive prize spread&amp;ndash;our numbers ballooned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was there we decided to move our puzzle solving from the post/reply world of Reddit to the real time organized conversation style of Discord. I&amp;rsquo;m a millennial in my mid 30s. Discord reminded me of the old school AOL chat rooms&amp;ndash;and it felt like the perfect platform to solve ARGs with. As a leader of the community&amp;ndash;I felt the move to discord would not only strengthen our puzzle solving abilities, but also allow the Mr Robot community as a whole, a place to meet and actually get to know one another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both our Reddit and discord have continued to grow beyond the show&amp;rsquo;s end. Between the two we have roughly 10,000 or so members.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) Would you say the people here are now good friends, keep in touch, friends for life?&lt;/strong>|&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d say that varies with every member in the group, right? Lots of our numbers lurk in the background&amp;ndash;yet keep an active status in the discord server. People come and go with discord servers all the time. Yet in ours, it seems people like to stay. Even some of the ARG team that developed the game itself, have become members of the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those of us active every day, are friends for life. I don&amp;rsquo;t see anyone going anywhere anytime soon. We have people from all walks of life on that server. I don&amp;rsquo;t travel to other discord servers all too much, but I have to imagine we have one of the most inclusive servers in all of the internet. We have members on every continent, speaking 24 hours a day. Cis, trans, nerds, jocks, hackers, jokesters, drinkers, smokers, midnight tokers.
Not only are we friends, but in this new COVID world we might even be the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) We like to give credit where its due. Who helped you?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Hmm, it was largely a group effort. Some key solvers&amp;ndash;and by key I mean, without them, we might still be stuck on those puzzles they solved, even today&amp;hellip; were @obafgkm, @cr4mb0, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SteveRipple">@RipVanWinkle&lt;/a>, @PunkAB, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bogie">@Bogie&lt;/a> among others. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/willdroid8">@Willvoid&lt;/a> did stellar work keeping the ARG map/timeline updated with every solve we made. Allowing new members easy access to catching up with where we presently were in the game. Every active member had a role in solving the ARG. Even down to those who just reminded us to focus when we were going off the rails. The names are too many to list.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) Anything else you would like to add?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d like to add that we as a community are ready for the next big ARG. The marvelous team at 5th column, and the work done behind the scenes by people we will never know about (but would have liked to), together led to a well deserved EMMY for best ARG in 2020. Frankly no other ARG came close to what the Mr Robot ARG has been year after year. I was glad to see the win come for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re ready for the future. But we&amp;rsquo;re gonna wait for the next show that deserves us.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>From everyone on the Kali team, well done ARGSociety! It looks like you guys haven&amp;rsquo;t yet stop, and are hunting to the other Easter eggs still left to be found! If you want to know more, get involved, join their &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARGsociety/">subreddit&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://discord.com/invite/2ERCJa2">discord&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will leave you now with a video by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dafreqs">@Beamofoldlight&lt;/a> from ARGSociety in his down time put together this of them completing the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARGsociety/wiki/index">final puzzle&lt;/a>, which really shows just &lt;a href="https://i.redd.it/enyq8z3ma6i51.jpg">how much effort&lt;/a> went into &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARGsociety/wiki/welcome">solving&lt;/a> it &lt;a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/581200568983355394/715015582197743636/arg-timeline-s4.pdf">all&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>At a higher level, the last 12 months of Kali Linux &lt;em>(outside of the normal release items - e.g. packages updates)&lt;/em>, Kali has had various refreshes, switches and additional new features added.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking a little deeper:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There has been a lot of &lt;strong>graphical &amp;amp; visual changes&lt;/strong> (e.g. desktop environments &amp;amp; shells refreshes)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>With a few &amp;ldquo;under-the-hood&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong>core system changes&lt;/strong> (e.g. switching to non-root &amp;amp; default shell)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>With a sprinkle of &lt;strong>end-user experience&lt;/strong> improvements (e.g. new system images &amp;amp; message at login)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have also been altering and tweaking the &lt;strong>back end infrastructure&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(just not been talking about it publicly in release notes)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have also introduced various &lt;strong>new features&lt;/strong> (e.g Kali-undercover &amp;amp; Win-KeX)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added support for &lt;strong>new platforms&lt;/strong> &amp;amp; improved current ones (e.g. Vagrant, AWS, ARM &amp;amp; NetHunter)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>We understand not everyone has liked the Python 2 tool removal, but it was necessary and did to help &lt;strong>future proof Kali&lt;/strong>. We know this is a painful process, deep change like this always is. But it will only get easier as time goes by and more tools update&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Breaking it down on a per Kali release, the &lt;strong>feature highlights&lt;/strong> from each release:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/">Kali 2019.4&lt;/a> (November 2019)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Switching to Xfce for default desktop environment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Xfce desktop environment refresh&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Git-powered Kali-docs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introducing Kali-Undercover + NetHunter-KeX&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1-release/">Kali 2020.1&lt;/a> (February 2020)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Switching to non-root user&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gnome desktop environment refresh&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Switch to single setup image&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Start of removing Python 2 tools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introducing NetHunter Rootless edition&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-2-release/">Kali 2020.2&lt;/a> (May 2020)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>KDE Plasma desktop environment refresh&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introducing LXC / LXD images&lt;/li>
&lt;li>NetHunter improvements to WiFi (in-built monitoring &amp;amp; injection)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introducing NetHunter USB Arsenal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introducing NetHunter Kernel-Builder&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-3-release/">Kali 2020.3&lt;/a> (August 2020)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>ZSH shell refresh&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introducing Win-KeX&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improving HiDPI support&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kali icon refresh&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kali setup improvements&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introducing NetHunter Bluetooth Arsenal&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-4-release/">Kali 2020.4&lt;/a> (November 2020)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Switching to ZSH as default shell&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bash shell refresh&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Messages at Login&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kali AWS image refresh&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support for VMware Vagrant&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support for Win-KeX on ARM&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Removed Python 2 tools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>NetHunter settings menu (Backup/restore + boot menu)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It goes without saying, that over the year we have updated countless amount of tools, as well as introduced 120 new ones. We also added more support for ARM &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://kalilinux.gitlab.io/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-devices/nethunter-kernelstats.html">NetHunter devices&lt;/a>. ARM we have a new 3 &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm">build scripts&lt;/a> and 1 new &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/">pre-generated images&lt;/a>. With Kali NetHunter we have:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://kalilinux.gitlab.io/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-devices/nethunter-images.html">13&lt;/a> new &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-devices">devices&lt;/a> (25% more)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://kalilinux.gitlab.io/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-devices/nethunter-kernels.html">20&lt;/a> new &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-kernel">kernels&lt;/a> (14% more)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>9 new &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-nethunter-download/">pre-generated images&lt;/a> plus 2 generic images (50% more)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s looking back on 2019 &amp;amp; 2020. But what does it look like looking forward to 2021?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2019/2020 was a focus on the interface of Kali. 2021 is going to be more tool focused&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The only thing we didn&amp;rsquo;t manage was to port over kali.org/tools/ to markdown - so that&amp;rsquo;s still on the cards&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Speaking of websites, we are going to be giving our website a face lift&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The release of &amp;ldquo;Kaboxer&amp;rdquo; - a project we have been working on for the last 18 months&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We are hoping to do an online event, aiming for August - more details about that in Kali 2021.2&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Giving a make over to the community support (forums and real time chat)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improving the bug tracker&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We hope to get to as many of those items as we can, as well as a few other things that we have up our sleeves. With that all said, see you for Kali 2021.1, which we are planning on &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/releases/">releasing&lt;/a> a little later next year &lt;em>(currently penciled in for a Tuesday in February 2021)&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Announcing Kali Linux Newsletter + Keeping in Touch</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-newsletter-keeping-in-touch/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-newsletter-keeping-in-touch/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-newsletter-keeping-in-touch/images/kali-newsletter-1.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Today we are announcing the Kali Linux newsletter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s easy to miss certain news. Not everyone is regularly checking our web page to see if something has been posted &lt;em>(and we don&amp;rsquo;t have a regular schedule of when we update)&lt;/em>. It is easy to be drowned out in social networks with everything else going on. And RSS feeds have not been as common as they once were. So to try and help keep you in the loop with Kali Linux, we now have a newsletter option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The contents of the newsletter will mirror &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/">our blog posts&lt;/a> &lt;em>(we are not trying to market or sell anything to you)&lt;/em>. Once a day, if there has been any new posts, we will now send a copy direct to your inbox.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to, please sign up to the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/newsletter/">Kali Linux newsletter&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stay tuned, as we are going to keep working on other ways to improve our communication and community interaction in 2021!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s different with this release since &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-3-release/">2020.3 in August 2020&lt;/a> is:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="zsh-shell-by-default">ZSH Shell By Default&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-3-release/">previous quarterly release, 2020.3&lt;/a>, we gave a heads up that we will be &lt;strong>switching from Bash to ZSH as our default shell going forwards&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(where possible)&lt;/em>. We are happy to announce that after testing and feedback from users, the switch &lt;strong>has now happened&lt;/strong>. Say hello to ZSH.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ echo &amp;quot;Hello World. I'm $0&amp;quot;
Hello World. I'm zsh
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Thank you to everyone who provided positive and constructive feedback. We are happy with it, and hope you are too. With that said, we know we cannot please everyone with it &lt;em>(so if you wish to revert back to Bash, please do: &lt;code>chsh -s /bin/bash&lt;/code>)&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ZSH will be the default shell on our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/">desktop images&lt;/a> (amd64/i386), and &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/cloud/">cloud&lt;/a>.
For the time being, other platforms (e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/">ARM&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/containers/">containers&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter/">NetHunter&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/wsl/">WSL&lt;/a>/) will still use Bash. We hope to switch more over in later versions.
If you use &lt;code>adduser&lt;/code>, regardless of the platform, it will also default to Bash for the time being &lt;em>(to avoid some edge cases of items breaking)&lt;/em>. In time, this will be changed as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How do I get it?&lt;/strong> Good question! If you:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do a fresh install of Kali Linux 2020.4 or later, it will &amp;ldquo;just happen&amp;rdquo; during the setup.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/">updating Kali&lt;/a>, you will need to switch each user to ZSH (e.g. non-root &amp;amp; root since Kali Linux does not use the root account since &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1-release/">2020.1&lt;/a>/).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I need to switch. How do I?&lt;/strong> This can be done by applying our default &lt;code>zshrc&lt;/code> file. If you are not already using ZSH, you can simply copy it over. If you are, you will need to overwrite (make sure to backup first).&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ [ -e ~/.zshrc ] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cp -i ~/.zshrc{,.bak}
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ cp -i /etc/skel/.zshrc ~/
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ chsh -s /bin/zsh
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ zsh
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;em>If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, you may also be the type of person who likes Easter eggs - our prompts contain a few! If you go looking you may find a few gems (e.g. &lt;code>new_line_before_prompt&lt;/code> &amp;amp; root vs non-root).&lt;/em>_&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bash-shell-makeover">Bash Shell Makeover&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Kali Linux now has a universal, cross-shell theme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whilst we were tweaking ZSH, we also updated our Bash prompt (&lt;code>$PS1&lt;/code>), to make it feel similar &lt;em>(but not act similar)&lt;/em> to our ZSH prompt. We started playing with the Bash prompt in &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-3-release/">Kali Linux 2020.3&lt;/a>, when the colors changed for non-root users, from red to blue. Before then, we had not changed it since Kali Linux was &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-0-release/">first released&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-4-release/images/bash.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How do I get it?&lt;/strong> Another good question! Very similar answer to ZSH, but this time using &lt;code>.bashrc&lt;/code> instead. If you are doing:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A fresh installation of Kali Linux 2020.4 or later, it&amp;rsquo;s already applied.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/">updating Kali&lt;/a>, you will need to configure each user (e.g. non-root &amp;amp; root/)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you have made any alterations to &lt;code>~/.bashrc&lt;/code>, make sure to back it up before replacing it.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ cp -i .bashrc{,.bak}
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ cp -i /etc/skel/.bashrc ~/
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ source ~/.bashrc
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$ echo &amp;quot;Hello World. I'm $0&amp;quot;
Hello World. I'm bash
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;em>If you look &amp;amp; edit the contents of &lt;code>.bashrc&lt;/code>, you can switch to the red &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.backtrack-linux.org/">BackTrack&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; prompt to be nostalgic.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="partnership-with-tools-authors-byt3bl33d3rs-crackmapexec-cme">Partnership with tools authors: byt3bl33d3r&amp;rsquo;s CrackMapExec (CME)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Kali Linux is part of the greater community and we want to support tool authors where possible. If you have not heard of &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/crackmapexec">CrackMapExec (a.k.a CME)&lt;/a>, you may be missing a trick &lt;em>(or three)&lt;/em> when it comes to doing infrastructure assessments (especially involving Active Directory).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We noticed that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/byt3bl33d3r/status/1275611300194705409">byt3bl33d3r&lt;/a> made the decision to move to a sponsorware model. You may or may not agree with his decision, but we understand &lt;a href="https://porchetta.industries/2020/11/17/And-Now-For-Something-Completely-Diffrent/">his reasoning&lt;/a>. The tools which he makes are highly valuable and relied upon by many. We want to support him and our Kali Linux users. After various calls and email exchanges, we are delighted to reveal &lt;strong>Kali has partnered with byt3bl33d3r&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What does this mean for me?&lt;/strong> The Kali package of CME is now pulling from a private source, allowing Kali Linux users to get access to the newest changes in CME &lt;strong>30 days&lt;/strong> before the tool is made public to everyone else. If you don&amp;rsquo;t use Kali, you either need to &lt;a href="https://github.com/sponsors/byt3bl33d3r">sponsor directly&lt;/a> or wait for it to be released after 30 days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Why are you doing this?&lt;/strong> Because we believe in Open-source and the community as a whole. This way, everyone benefits; both authors and users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Kali is Open-source. What is stopping me from stealing/ripping/cloning from you?&lt;/strong> The code will be distributed with a banner saying something along the lines of, &amp;ldquo;for Kali users only&amp;rdquo;. Removing/altering the code will break the software license thus breaking copyright law. Do not be that guy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Is that it?&lt;/strong> Yes! &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/policy/kali-linux-open-source-policy/">Kali Linux is Open-source&lt;/a>. We understand and respect software licenses, and by doing so we hope to keep everything Open-source as much as possible. Putting checks &amp;amp; protection in place, you may be happy using someone else&amp;rsquo;s cracked/pirated software (warez) - but do you know &lt;a href="https://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2013/09/05/how-to-crack-cobalt-strike-and-backdoor-it/">what has been altered under the hood&lt;/a>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But Kali Linux being Open-source, has to respect other people license agreements, as do any other respectable organizations. This also includes when tools which have their license agreements changed in &lt;a href="https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3/issues/208">software updates&lt;/a>, as a result, we have removed them from Kali.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have more to announce about direction step in a 2021.x release &lt;em>(as well as looking for other authors to sponsor with)&lt;/em>. Stay tuned for more information!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="message-at-login">Message At Login&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have noticed there being a large uprise of the amount of people saying &amp;ldquo;Kali Linux is missing &amp;lsquo;XYZ&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;XYZ feature is broken&amp;rdquo;, when this is not always the case. We have done our best to write up various issues on &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/">our docs pages&lt;/a>, however it appears they are not always being read. We also know that not everyone has a unix beard as long as &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/about-us/">@elwood-offsec&lt;/a>, but hope you still are an &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux/">experienced Linux user&lt;/a>. There is always a reason why something is the way it is, but it may require more than the usual basic troubleshooting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With all of that said, we are wanting to improve our communications going forwards. Most of the actions in Kali are done by the command line. So now, upon logging into a Kali terminal or console, you may be presented with a mixture of the following &lt;em>(depending on the configuration of your system, as it is dynamic)&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We hope this helps various common problems to be quickly fixed, but at the same time, not feel intrusive. Each of the issues have a link to our documentation page in order to correct the issue. After its been addressed, the message should not be displayed again. For whatever reason (unable or do not want to), you can permanently hide any messages from us being displayed by doing: &lt;code>touch ~/.hushlogin&lt;/code> (per user) or &lt;code>touch /etc/kali-motd/disable-all&lt;/code> (for a global setting).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have a few other things in the works to help communicate items out planned for 2021.x. Stay tuned!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="aws-ec2-cloud-image-refresh">AWS EC2 Cloud Image Refresh&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Kali Linux has been on &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/cloud/aws/">AWS&lt;/a> since &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-6-release/">1.0.6&lt;/a>. Over the years, we have done various refreshes of our &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts">build-scripts&lt;/a> to produce the &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-cloud">cloud images&lt;/a>. Finally with Kali 2020.2, we have a fully automated system in place. However during the changeover, we were shipping the image without any GUI or any tools by default. This was to give the cleanest, smallest image as possible. In hindsight, we didn&amp;rsquo;t communicate this change over well, and a lot of you noticed &amp;ldquo;tools missing&amp;rdquo; (as &lt;code>kali-linux-default&lt;/code> was not included/). However, in 2020.4, we have created a new metapackage, &lt;code>kali-linux-headless&lt;/code>, and included it which only has the default set of command line tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upon doing the refresh, we have worked with AWS to get Kali Linux added to &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kalilinux/status/1321453286067707904">GovCloud&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;. Which may be useful to a certain audience. With how the accounts were setup, we have had to start from fresh. &lt;strong>As a result, we have a &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08LL91KKB">new marketplace entry&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What does this mean for people who are using the old entry? As Kali Linux is a rolling distribution, not a lot! You can still keep &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/">updating Kali Linux&lt;/a> as usual. However, you will no longer be able to spin up the latest version using the latest instance. For that, you will need to switch to the new entry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: We have tried to say it as many different places as possible, but putting it here is not going to hurt. The default login for &lt;strong>AWS EC2 username is &amp;ldquo;kali&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> (not the standard &amp;ldquo;ec2-user&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-docs--packaging-guides">Kali-Docs &amp;amp; Packaging Guides&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/">2019.4&lt;/a>, we moved &lt;code>https://docs.kali.org/&lt;/code> from a WordPress solution to &lt;code>https://www.kali.org/docs/&lt;/code> using Hugo. In September, we finished &lt;em>(for now)&lt;/em> tweaking the theme, making it easier to use, super fast at loading and easier to &lt;strong>anyone&lt;/strong> to edit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have started to go though all the pages and refreshing them, bringing them all up-to-date, and adding more in. We are doing it section by section, and so far have completed the first three (so we still have a way to go! After it is completed, it will be easier to keep them up-to-date, making it an on-going task. For the sections that are missing or lacking content, we have been generating &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/documentation/kali-docs/-/boards/1429718">issues to help track&lt;/a>. If you want to help get &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/community/contribute/">involved with Kali Linux&lt;/a>, this is an easy place to start.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have also created various new pages, all about our packaging process:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/setting-up-packaging-system/">Setting Up A System For Packaging&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="new-tools--updates">New Tools &amp;amp; Updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As with every Kali release, there are new tools and updates. The &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/linux">kernel&lt;/a> got an upgrade to 5.9, so you benefit with all the loveliness that that brings. We have switched to &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/proxychains-ng">proxychains4&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; (aka &lt;a href="https://github.com/rofl0r/proxychains-ng">ProxyChains-NG&lt;/a>) as the default (everything from v3 should still work: same flags and configuration files &amp;amp; folder locations for legacy users, else the paths will reflect the version if starting from fresh). Also, &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/meta-gnome3">GNOME&lt;/a> was updated to 3.38 &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/meta-kde">KDE&lt;/a> to 5.19.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>New tools in Kali Linux:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/apple-bleee">Apple bleee&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/certgraph">CertGraph&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/dnscat2">dnscat2&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/finalrecon">FinalRecon&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/godoh">goDoH&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/hostapd-mana">hostapd-mana&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/metasploit-framework">Metasploit Framework v6&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/whatmask">Whatmask&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>One last thing. We have tweaked how we handle our wallpaper packages:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>kali-wallpapers-all&lt;/code> ~ Give me all the wallpapers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>kali-wallpapers-2019.4&lt;/code> ~ Default for Kali Linux between 2019.4 and 2020.3&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>kali-wallpapers-2020.4&lt;/code> ~ Default for Kali Linux between 2020.4 and onwards&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>kali-wallpapers-legacy&lt;/code> ~ Nostalgic value&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="kali-nethunter">Kali NetHunter&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>@yesimxev has added a new settings menu, allowing for easy back up and restore of configuration files. It also allows you to change the Kali NetHunter boot animation. How is this as a teaser?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-4-release/images/boot-kali.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Call on all boot animation devs out there: We&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you. If you have a cool boot animation you&amp;rsquo;d like to share, please submit a merge request to our &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/apps/kali-nethunter-bootanimation">Kali NetHunter boot animation repository&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new images also contain a &amp;ldquo;Magisk persistence&amp;rdquo; module, so we no longer have to flash Magisk again after we installed Kali NetHunter.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="win-kex-25">Win-KeX 2.5&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Win-KeX 2.5 includes a new &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-hyper-v-guest-enhanced-session-mode/">Enhanced Session Mode&lt;/a> (&amp;ndash;esm)&amp;rdquo;, which works like the &amp;ldquo;Window&amp;rdquo; mode but uses the Remote Deskop Protocol (RDP/) &amp;amp; client native to Windows. This mode will allow users of &amp;ldquo;Windows on ARM&amp;rdquo; devices to use Win-KeX and it adds sharpness to Win-KeX on HiDPI devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have also added a &lt;code>--ip&lt;/code> option to address a bug in WoA causing massive packet losses when using &amp;ldquo;localhost&amp;rdquo;. To start Win-KeX with sound on arm devices, just type:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ kex --esm --ip --sound
kali@kali:~$
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>--ip&lt;/code> parameter has one little downside though: Win-KeX asks for the Kali Linux user password when launched for the first time and stores it in the Windows credentials store. Since the IP address changes after every reboot, you will be prompted again. This is a known WSL2 bug and we&amp;rsquo;ll expect it to be fixed soon so that we can drop the &lt;code>--ip&lt;/code> parameter and we&amp;rsquo;ll never have to enter the password again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-4-release/images/surface-kex.png" alt="Win-KeX 2.5 on a Surface Pro X">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-vagrant--vmware">Kali Vagrant &amp;amp; VMware&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have had a Vagrant image since &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2018-3-release/">Kali Linux 2018.3&lt;/a>. However, it&amp;rsquo;s always been for VirtualBox. Until now. We are now also producing a VMware &lt;a href="https://app.vagrantup.com/kalilinux/boxes/rolling">Vagrant image&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note, you will need to have a separate license for both VMware and &lt;a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/vmware">Vagrant&lt;/a> for this to work, as it is a paid-for plugin.
For more information, you can see &lt;a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/vmware/usage">here&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/basic_usage">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-arm-devices">Kali ARM devices&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have been working away on our &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/">ARM images&lt;/a> as usual, and this release is no exception. We have reduced the amount of pre-generated images (now 14) as there has not been the demand for these other devices. We have left their &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm">build scripts&lt;/a> (now up to 43 devices supported), in case you wish to generate the images yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community-shoutouts">Community Shoutouts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Following on from last time, these are people from the public who have helped Kali and the team for the last release. We are super grateful and want to praise them for their work (giving credit where due!):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>@1y for generating a ARM build script for a new device, &lt;code>imx6-ull-evk&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/dracode">@dracode&lt;/a> for the awesome work on NetHunter, in particular the GPS fixes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/Mirivan">@mirivan&lt;/a> for all the amazing additions and fixes to NetHunter as well as helping out with the issue tracker.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/TheMMcOfficial">@TheMMcOfficial&lt;/a> for his continued help with NetHunter and DuckHunter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/Martinvlba">@Martinvlba&lt;/a> for his great contributions to NetHunter, especially hostapd&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/s133py">@s133py&lt;/a> for all the tireless work on NetHunter and helping with issues&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Not a community member per se, but we do want to give an honorable mention to &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab&lt;/a>. Kali Linux is now a &lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/partners/">Open-Source Partner&lt;/a> &lt;em>(different to their &lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/">Open-Source Program&lt;/a>)&lt;/em>. We made the switch &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-roadmap-2019-2020/">middle of 2019&lt;/a>, and we could not have been happier. Thank you GitLab for supporting &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux">us&lt;/a>, and for everything you do for the Open-source communities as a whole!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fresh Images&lt;/strong>:
So what are you waiting for? Start &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">downloading&lt;/a> already!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seasoned Kali Linux users are already aware of this, but for the ones who are not, we do also produce &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/">weekly builds&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> that you can use as well. If you cannot wait for our next release and you want the latest packages when you download the image, you can just use the weekly image instead. This way you&amp;rsquo;ll have fewer updates to do. &lt;em>Just know that these are automated builds that we do not QA like we do our standard release images&lt;/em>. But we gladly take bug reports about those images because we want any issues to be fixed before our next release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Existing Upgrades&lt;/strong>:
If you already have an existing Kali Linux installation, remember you can always do a quick &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/">update&lt;/a>, followed by setting the default shell to ZSH. If you&amp;rsquo;re already using ZSH, and want our new configuration, you can do the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ echo &amp;quot;deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib&amp;quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt -y full-upgrade
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ cp -i /etc/skel/.bashrc ~/
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ cp -i /etc/skel/.zshrc ~/
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ chsh -s /bin/zsh
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo reboot -f
kali@kali:~$
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You should now be on Kali Linux 2020.4. We can do a quick check by doing:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ grep VERSION /etc/os-release
VERSION=&amp;quot;2020.4&amp;quot;
VERSION_ID=&amp;quot;2020.4&amp;quot;

After its initial release, we asked ourselves if that is truly the limit of what we can achieve or could we pull off something incredible to mark the 25th anniversary of Hackers? What about &amp;ldquo;a second concurrent session as root&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;seamless desktop integration with Windows&amp;rdquo;, or - dare we dream - &amp;ldquo;sound&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With no further further ado, we are thrilled to present to you &lt;strong>Win-KeX v2.0&lt;/strong> with the following features:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Win-KeX SL (Seamless Edition)&lt;/strong> - bye bye borders&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sound support&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Multi-session support&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>KeX sessions can be run as root&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Able to launch &amp;ldquo;kex&amp;rdquo; from anywhere&lt;/strong> - no more cd-ing into the Kali filesystem required&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Shared clipboard&lt;/strong> - cut and paste content between Kali and Windows apps&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Win-KeX Window mode is the classic Win-KeX look and feel with one dedicated window for the Kali Linux desktop. To launch Win-KeX in Window mode with sound support, type: &lt;code>kex --win -s&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Win-KeX SL mode provides a seamless integration of Kali Linux into the Windows desktop with the Windows Start menu at the bottom and the Kali panel at the top of the screen. All applications are launched in their own windows sharing the same desktop as Windows applications. &lt;code>kex --sl --s&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h6 id="to-enable-sound">To enable sound:&lt;/h6>
&lt;p>Start Win-KeX with the &lt;code>--sound&lt;/code> or &lt;code>-s&lt;/code> command line parameter. We&amp;rsquo;ve been watching Blu-rays in Win-KeX SL without problems. Why you ask? Because - now we can ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;h6 id="win-kex-now-supports-concurrent-sessions">Win-KeX now supports concurrent sessions&lt;/h6>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Win-KeX as unprivileged user&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Win-KeX as root user&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Win-KeX SL&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h6 id="windows-firewall">Windows Firewall&lt;/h6>
&lt;p>Both SL mode and sound support require access through the Windows Defender firewall. When prompted, tick &amp;ldquo;Public networks&amp;rdquo;. You can later go to the firewall settings and restrict the scope to the WSL network (usually &lt;code>172.3x.xxx.0/20&lt;/code>)&lt;/p>
&lt;h6 id="manpage">Manpage&lt;/h6>
&lt;p>Forgotten that lifesaving parameter? Try:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">kex --help

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="new-shell-is-coming">New Shell (Is Coming)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Most people who use Kali Linux, &lt;em>(&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux/">we hope&lt;/a>)&lt;/em>, are very experienced Linux users. As a result, they feel very comfortable around the command line. We understand that &amp;ldquo;shells&amp;rdquo; are a very personal and precious thing to everyone (local or remote!), as that is how most people interact with Kali Linux. To the point where lots of experienced users only use a &amp;ldquo;GUI&amp;rdquo; to spin up multiple terminals. By default, Kali Linux has always used &amp;ldquo;bash&amp;rdquo; &lt;em>(aka &amp;ldquo;Bourne-Again SHell&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/em> as the default shell, when you open up a terminal or console. Any seasoned Kali user would know the prompt &lt;code>kali@kali:~$&lt;/code> &lt;em>(or &lt;code>root@kali:~#&lt;/code> for the older users!/)&lt;/em> very well!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, we are announcing the plan to switch over to &lt;strong>ZSH shell&lt;/strong>. This is currently scheduled to be the &lt;strong>default shell in 2020.4&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(for this &lt;strong>2020.3 release, bash will still be the default&lt;/strong>)&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have a &lt;strong>fresh default install&lt;/strong> of Kali Linux 2020.3, you should have ZSH already installed &lt;em>(if not, do &lt;code>sudo apt install -y zsh zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions&lt;/code>)&lt;/em>, ready for a try.
However if you installed an earlier version of Kali Linux and have &lt;strong>upgraded to 2020.3&lt;/strong>, your user will be lacking the default ZSH configuration that we cooked with lots of love. So for upgrade users only, make sure to copy the configuration file:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ cp /etc/skel/.zshrc ~/
kali@kali:~$
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Then all you need to do is switch to ZSH:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ zsh
âââ(kaliã¿kali)-[~]
ââ$
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-3-release/images/release-2020.3-zsh.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you like what you see, you can &lt;strong>set ZSH as your default&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(replacing bash)&lt;/em> by doing &lt;code>chsh -s /bin/zsh&lt;/code>. &lt;em>Which is what we will be doing in 2020.4&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wanted to give the community a notice before this switch happens. This is a very large change (some may argue larger than the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/">Gnome to Xfce switch last year&lt;/a>). &lt;strong>We are also looking for &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/main_page.php">feedback&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. We hope we have the right balance of design and functionality, but we know these typically don&amp;rsquo;t get done perfect the first time. And, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to overload the default shell with too many features, as lower powered devices will then struggle or it may be hard to on the eyes to read. ZSH has been something we have wanted to do for a long time &lt;em>(even before the switch over to &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/">Xfce&lt;/a>!)&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will be doing extensive testing during this next cycle so we reserve the right to delay the default change, or change direction all together. Again, we encourage you to provide &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/main_page.php">feedback&lt;/a> on this process. There is no way we can cover every use case on our own, so &lt;strong>your help is important&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) Why did you make the switch? What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with bash?&lt;/strong>
A.) You can do a lot of advanced things with bash, and customize it to do even more, but ZSH allows you to do even more. This was one really large selling point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) Why did you pick ZSH and not fish?&lt;/strong>
A.) In the discussion of switching shells, one of the options that came up is Fish &lt;em>(Friendly Interactive SHell)&lt;/em>. Fish is a nice shell &lt;em>(probably nicer than ZSH)&lt;/em>, but realistically it was not a real consideration due to the fact that it is not POSIX compatible. This would cause a lot of issues, as common one-liners just won&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q.) Are you going to use any ZSH frameworks (e.g. Oh-My-ZSH or Prezto)?&lt;/strong>
A.) At this point in time, by default, no. The weight of these would not be workable for lower powered devices. You can still install them yourself afterwards &lt;em>(as many of our team do)&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="win-kex">Win-KeX&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Having Kali Linux on &amp;ldquo;Windows Subsystem for Linux&amp;rdquo; (WSL) is something &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-on-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/">we have been taking advantage of&lt;/a> since it came out. With the release of &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/wsl2-and-kali/">WSLv2&lt;/a>, the overall functionality and user experience improved dramatically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, the experience is improving once more with the introduction of &lt;strong>Win-KeX&lt;/strong> (Windows + Kali Desktop EXperience). After installing it, typing in &lt;code>kex&lt;/code>, or clicking on the button, Win-KeX will give you a &lt;strong>persistent-session GUI&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-3-release/images/release-2020.3-win-kex.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After getting WSL installed &lt;em>(there&amp;rsquo;s countless guides online, or you can follow &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/wsl/win-kex/">ours&lt;/a>/)&lt;/em>, you can install &lt;code>Win-KeX&lt;/code> by doing the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt install -y kali-win-kex
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Afterwards, if you want to make a shortcut, follow our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/wsl/win-kex/">guide&lt;/a>, or you can just type in &lt;code>kex&lt;/code>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the subject of &lt;strong>WSL&lt;/strong> (and this is true for &lt;strong>Docker&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>AWS EC2&lt;/strong>) something we have seen a bit is after getting a desktop environment, people have noticed the tools are not &amp;ldquo;there&amp;rdquo;. This is because they are &lt;strong>not included by default&lt;/strong>, to keep the image as small as possible. You either need to manually install them one by one, or grab the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/">default metapackage&lt;/a> to get all the tools from out-of-the-box: &lt;code>sudo apt install -y kali-linux-default&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please note, Win-KeX does require &lt;strong>WSL v2 on x64&lt;/strong> as it&amp;rsquo;s not compatible with WSL v1, or arm64.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more information, please see our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/wsl/win-kex/">documentation page on Win-KeX&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automating-hidpi">Automating HiDPI&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>HiDPI displays are getting more and more common. Unfortunately, Linux support, out of the box, hasn&amp;rsquo;t been great &lt;em>(older Linux users may remember a time where this was very common for a lot of hardware changes.)&lt;/em>. Which means after doing a fresh install, there is a bit of tweaking required to get it working, otherwise the font/text/display may be very small to read. We have &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/hidpi/">had a guide&lt;/a> out explaining the process required to get it working, but the process before was a little &amp;ldquo;fiddly&amp;rdquo;. &lt;strong>We wanted to do better&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we made &lt;strong>kali-hidpi-mode&lt;/strong>. Now, either typing in &lt;code>kali-hidpi-mode&lt;/code> or selecting it from the menu &lt;em>(as shown below)&lt;/em>, should automate switching between HiDPI modes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-3-release/images/release-2020.3-hidpi.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tool-icons">Tool Icons&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the last few releases, we have been showing the progress on getting more themed icons for tools. We can now say, if you use the &lt;strong>default tool listing&lt;/strong> (&lt;code>kali-linux-default&lt;/code>), &lt;strong>every tool in the menu&lt;/strong> (and then a few extra ones!), should have their &lt;strong>own icon&lt;/strong> now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-3-release/images/release-2020.3-icons.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will be working on adding missing tools to the menu (and creating icons for them) over the next few releases of Kali, as well as expanding into the &lt;code>kali-linux-large&lt;/code> &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/">metapackage&lt;/a> (then &lt;code>kali-tools-everything&lt;/code>/). We also have plans for these icons, outside of the menu - more information in an upcoming release!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We are proud to introduce &lt;strong>Bluetooth Arsenal&lt;/strong> by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yesimxev">yesimxev&lt;/a> from the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/about-us/">Kali NetHunter team&lt;/a>. It combines a set of bluetooth tools in the Kali NetHunter app with some pre-configured workflows and exciting use cases. You can use your external adapter for &lt;strong>reconnaissance&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>spoofing&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>listening to&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>injecting audio&lt;/strong> into various devices, including speakers, headsets, watches, or even cars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please note that &lt;code>RFCOMM&lt;/code> and &lt;code>RFCOMM tty&lt;/code> will need to be &lt;strong>enabled in kernels&lt;/strong> from now on to support some of the tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-3-release/images/release-2020.3-nh-bluetooth.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-nethunter-for-nokia-phones">Kali NetHunter for Nokia Phones&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Kali NetHunter now supports the &lt;strong>Nokia 3.1&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Nokia 6.1&lt;/strong> phones, thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yesimxev">yesimxev&lt;/a>. Images are available on our &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-nethunter-download/">download site&lt;/a>. Please note that those images contain a &amp;ldquo;minimal Kali rootfs&amp;rdquo; due to technical reasons but you can easily install all the default tools via &lt;code>sudo apt install -y kali-linux-default&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-3-release/images/release-2020.3-nokia-nethunter.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setup-process">Setup Process&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The full installer image always had all the packages required for an offline installation but if you installed a Kali Linux system with this image and without disabling the network, the installer would automatically run &lt;code>dist-upgrade&lt;/code> &lt;strong>during&lt;/strong> the install. This is done to make sure that you have the latest packages on first boot. And that step can &lt;strong>take a very long time&lt;/strong>, especially after a few months after a release when &lt;strong>lots of updates&lt;/strong> have accumulated. &lt;strong>Starting with 2020.3, we disabled the network mirror in the full installer&lt;/strong> so that you always get the &lt;strong>same installation speed&lt;/strong>, and the &lt;strong>same packages and versions&lt;/strong> for that release &lt;em>- just make sure to &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/">update&lt;/a> after installing&lt;/em>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whilst we were at it, we fixed another related issue. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t have network access &lt;em>(either voluntarily or otherwise)&lt;/em> during installation, you would get an empty &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/kali-linux-sources-list-repositories/">network repository&lt;/a> (&lt;code>/etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/code>/). This means, you would not be able to use &lt;code>apt&lt;/code> to install additional packages. While there might be some users who will never have network, we believe that it&amp;rsquo;s best to actually configure that file in &lt;strong>all cases&lt;/strong>. &lt;strong>So that&amp;rsquo;s what we did&lt;/strong>. By default, any fresh installs going forward after 2020.3 will have &lt;strong>network repositories pre-defined&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="arm-device-updates">ARM Device Updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have (along with the work of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/frangalinux">Francisco Jose RodrÃ­guez Martos&lt;/a> who did a lot of the back end changes) refreshed our &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm">build-scripts for our ARM devices&lt;/a>. We &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/">pre-generated various different ARM images&lt;/a> &lt;em>(as of 2020.3 - 19 images)&lt;/em> to allow for quick download and deployment, but we have build scripts for more &lt;em>(as of 2020.3 - 39 images)&lt;/em>. If your device is not one of ones that we release images for, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to use the scripts to self generate the image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notable changes in ARM&amp;rsquo;s 2020.3 release:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>All of the ARM images&lt;/strong> come with &lt;strong>&lt;code>kali-linux-default&lt;/code> &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/">metapackage&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> installed, bringing them in line with the rest of our releases, so &lt;strong>more tools are available when you first boot&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have &lt;strong>reduced the size of all our ARM images&lt;/strong> that are created, so downloads should be smaller. However, you will still need to use &lt;strong>at least a 16GB&lt;/strong> sdcard/USB drive/eMMC&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pinebook&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Pinebook Pro&lt;/strong> images can now be used on &lt;strong>either sdcard or eMMC&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>Pinebook&lt;/strong> image now has the WiFi driver built during image creation, instead of on first boot, this should &lt;strong>speed up first boot time&lt;/strong> massively&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>Pinebook Pro&lt;/strong> has a change from the upstream firmware, which changes &lt;code>ccode=DE&lt;/code> to &lt;code>ccode=all&lt;/code> - this allows &lt;strong>access to more 2.4GHz and 5GHz&lt;/strong> channels&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>64-bit RaspberryPi&lt;/strong> images now have the RaspberryPi &lt;strong>userland utilities&lt;/strong> built during image creation, so &lt;code>vcgencmd&lt;/code> and various other utilities that were previously only available on the 32-bit image are now usable on 64-bit as well&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>ODROID-C2&lt;/strong> image now uses the Kali kernel, instead of a vendor provided one. This means in the future, an &lt;code>apt dist-upgrade&lt;/code> will get you kernel updates instead of waiting for a new Kali release&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;code>/etc/fstab&lt;/code> file now &lt;strong>includes the root partition via UUID&lt;/strong>, this should make it &lt;strong>easier when trying to use a USB drive&lt;/strong> instead of sdcard on devices that support it&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A few things which are work in progress:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>RaspberryPi&lt;/strong> images are using 4.19 kernels. We would like to move to 5.4 however, &lt;code>nexmon&lt;/code> isn&amp;rsquo;t working properly with it &lt;em>(as the new kernel requires firmware version =&amp;gt; 7.45.202)&lt;/em> for which &lt;a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon/issues/423">no nexmon patch exists yet&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is a new &lt;strong>USBArmory Mk2&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm">build script&lt;/a>. We don&amp;rsquo;t have the hardware to test it however, so we are looking for community feedback who is able to test it out&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Veyron&lt;/strong> image will be released at a later date to kernel issues that haven&amp;rsquo;t yet been tracked down&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="desktop-environment">Desktop Environment&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As there has been minor update to Gnome, we have been taking some advantages of the new settings:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>GNOME&amp;rsquo;s file manager &lt;code>nautilus&lt;/code> has a new theme&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GNOME&amp;rsquo;s system-monitor now matches the colors and also has stacked CPU charts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improved the design for &amp;ldquo;nested headerbars&amp;rdquo; &lt;em>(example, in the Settings Window, where the left headerbar is joined with the side-navbar)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-3-release/images/release-2020.3-gnome.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community-shoutouts">Community Shoutouts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A new section in the release notes, community shoutouts. These are &lt;strong>people from the public who have helped Kali&lt;/strong> and the team for the last release. And we want to praise them for their work &lt;em>(we like to give credit where due!)&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/crashbrz">Crash&lt;/a> who has been helping the community for some time now, thank you!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FrangaLinux">FrangaL&lt;/a> who has been doing some great work with Kali Linux ARM, thank you!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Anyone can help out, anyone can get &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/community/contribute/">involved&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="download-kali-linux-20203">Download Kali Linux 2020.3&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fresh Images&lt;/strong>
So what are you waiting for? Start &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">downloading&lt;/a> already!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seasoned Kali Linux users are already aware of this, but for the ones who are not, we do also produce &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/">weekly builds&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> that you can use as well. If you can&amp;rsquo;t wait for our next release and you want the latest packages when you download the image, you can just use the weekly image instead. This way you&amp;rsquo;ll have fewer updates to do. &lt;em>Just know these are automated builds that we don&amp;rsquo;t QA like we do our standard release images&lt;/em>. But we gladly take bug reports about those images because we want any issues to be fixed before our next release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Existing Upgrades&lt;/strong>
If you already have an existing Kali Linux installation, remember you can always do a quick &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/">update&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ echo &amp;quot;deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib&amp;quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt -y full-upgrade
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo reboot -f
kali@kali:~$
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You should now be on Kali Linux 2020.3. We can do a quick check by doing:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ grep VERSION /etc/os-release
VERSION=&amp;quot;2020.3&amp;quot;
VERSION_ID=&amp;quot;2020.3&amp;quot;
VERSION_CODENAME=&amp;quot;kali-rolling&amp;quot;

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>NOTE: The output of &lt;code>uname -r&lt;/code> may be different depending on the system &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/linux-latest">architecture&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As always, should you come across any bugs in Kali, please submit a report on our &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/main_page.php">bug tracker&lt;/a>. &lt;em>We&amp;rsquo;ll never be able to fix what we don&amp;rsquo;t know is broken!&lt;/em> &lt;strong>And &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kalilinux">Twitter&lt;/a> is not a Bug Tracker!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux 2020.2 Release (KDE &amp; PowerShell)</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-2-release/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-2-release/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-2-release/images/kali-2020.2-release.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>Despite the turmoil in the world, we are thrilled to be bringing you an awesome update with Kali Linux 2020.2! And it is available for immediate &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">download&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A quick overview of what&amp;rsquo;s new since &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1-release/">January&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>KDE Plasma Makeover &amp;amp; Login&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PowerShell by Default. &lt;em>Kind of.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kali on ARM Improvements&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lessons From The Installer Changes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New Key Packages &amp;amp; Icons&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Behind the Scenes, Infrastructure Improvements&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="kde-plasma-makeover--login">KDE Plasma Makeover &amp;amp; Login&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/">Xfce&lt;/a> and GNOME having had a Kali Linux look and feel update, it&amp;rsquo;s time to go back to our roots &lt;em>(days of &lt;a href="https://www.backtrack-linux.org/">BackTrack&lt;/a>)&lt;/em> and give some love and attention to KDE Plasma. Introducing our dark and light themes for KDE Plasma:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-2-release/images/release-2020.2-kali-kde-dark.png" alt="">
&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-2-release/images/release-2020.2-kali-kde-light.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the subject of theming, we have also tweaked the login screen (&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/lightdm">lightdm&lt;/a>). It looks different, both graphically and the layout &lt;em>(the login boxes are aligned now)&lt;/em>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-2-release/images/release-2020.2-login-dark.png" alt="">
&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-2-release/images/release-2020.2-login-light.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="powershell-by-default-_kind-of_">PowerShell by Default. &lt;em>Kind of.&lt;/em>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/">A while ago&lt;/a>, we put PowerShell into &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/kali-linux-sources-list-repositories/">Kali Linux&amp;rsquo;s network repository&lt;/a>. This means if you wanted powershell, you had to install the package as a one off by doing:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install -y powershell
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We now have put PowerShell into one of our (primary) &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/">metapackages&lt;/a>, &lt;code>kali-linux-large&lt;/code>. This means, if you choose to install this metapackage during system setup, or once Kali is up and running &lt;em>(&lt;code>sudo apt install -y kali-linux-large&lt;/code>)&lt;/em>, if PowerShell is compatible with your architecture, you can just jump straight into it &lt;em>(&lt;code>pwsh&lt;/code>)&lt;/em>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PowerShell isn&amp;rsquo;t in &lt;em>the default&lt;/em> metapackage &lt;em>(that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>kali-linux-default&lt;/code>)&lt;/em>, but it is in the one that includes the default and many extras, and can be included during system setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="kali-on-arm-improvements">Kali on ARM Improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1-release/">Kali Linux 2020.1&lt;/a>, desktop images no longer used &amp;ldquo;root/toor&amp;rdquo; as the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/introduction/default-credentials/">default credentials&lt;/a> to login, but had moved to &amp;ldquo;kali/kali&amp;rdquo;. Our ARM images are now the same. We are no longer using the super user account to login with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also warned back in &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/">2019.4&lt;/a> that we would be moving away from a 8GB minimum SD card, and we are finally ready to pull the trigger on this. The requirement is now 16GB or larger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One last note on the subject of ARM devices, we are not installing &lt;code>locales-all&lt;/code> any more, so we highly recommend that you set your locale. This can be done by running the following command, &lt;code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales&lt;/code>, then log out and back in.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="lessons-from-installer-changes">Lessons From Installer Changes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1-release/">Kali Linux 2020.1&lt;/a> we announced our new style of images, &amp;ldquo;installer&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp; &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Issue&lt;/strong>
It was intended that both &amp;ldquo;installer&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp; &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; could be customized during setup, to select which metapackage and desktop environment to use. When we did that, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t include metapackages beyond default in those images, as it would create too large of an ISO. As the packages were not in the image, if you selected anything other than the default options it would require network access to obtain the missing packages beyond default. After release, we noticed some users selecting &amp;ldquo;everything&amp;rdquo; and then waiting hours for installs to happen. They couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand why the installs where taking so long.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also have used different software on the back end to generate these images, and a few bugs slipped through the cracks (which explains the &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=6053">2020.1a&lt;/a> and 2020.1b releases).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solutions&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We have removed &lt;code>kali-linux-everything&lt;/code> as an install time option (which is &lt;em>every&lt;/em> package in the Kali Linux repository) in the installer image, as you can imagine that would have taken a long time to download and wait for during install&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have cached &lt;code>kali-linux-large&lt;/code> &amp;amp; every desktop environment into the install image (which is why its a little larger than previous to download) - allowing for a &lt;strong>COMPLETE&lt;/strong> offline network install&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have removed customization for &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; images - the installer switched back to copying the content of the live filesystem allowing again full offline install but forcing usage of our default XFCE desktop&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-2-release/images/release-2020.2-setup.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Summary&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you are wanting to run Kali from a live image (DVD or USB stick), please use &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are wanting anything else, please use &amp;ldquo;installer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are wanting anything other than XFCE as your desktop environment, please use &amp;ldquo;installer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If you are not sure, get &amp;ldquo;installer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Also, please keep in mind on an actual assessment &amp;ldquo;more&amp;rdquo; is not always &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo;. There are very few reasons to install &lt;code>kali-linux-everything&lt;/code>, and many reasons not too. To those of you that were selecting this option, we highly suggest you &lt;a href="https://kali.training/">take some time and educate yourself on Kali&lt;/a> before using it. Kali, or any other pentest distribution, is not a &amp;ldquo;turn key auto hack&amp;rdquo; solution. You still need to learn your platform, learn your tools, and educate yourself in general.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider what you are really telling Kali to do when you are installing &lt;code>kali-linux-everything&lt;/code>. Its similar to if you went into your phones app store and said &amp;ldquo;install everything!&amp;rdquo;. Thats likely not to have good results. We provide a lot of powerful tools and options in Kali, and while we may have a reputation of &amp;ldquo;Providing machine guns to monkeys&amp;rdquo;, but we actually expect you to know what you are doing. Kali is not going to hold your hand. It expects you to do the work of learning and Kali will be unforgiving if you don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="new-key-packages--icons">New Key Packages &amp;amp; Icons&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Just like every Kali Linux release, we include the latest packages possible. Key ones to point out this release are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/meta-gnome3">GNOME 3.36&lt;/a> - a few of you may have noticed a bug that slipped in during the first 12 hours of the update being available. We&amp;rsquo;re sorry about this, and have measures in place for it to not happen again&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/joplin">Joplin&lt;/a> - we are planning on replacing &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/cherrytree">CherryTree&lt;/a> with this in Kali Linux 2020.3!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/nextnet">Nextnet&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/python3-defaults">Python 3.8&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/spiderfoot">SpiderFoot&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For the time being, as a temporary measure due to certain tools needing it, we have re-included &lt;code>python2-pip&lt;/code>. Python 2 has now reached &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/python-2-end-of-life/">End Of Life&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; and is no longer getting updated. Tool makers, please, please, &lt;strong>please&lt;/strong> port to Python 3. Users of tools, if you notice that a tool is not Python 3 yet, you can help too! It is not going to be around forever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whilst talking about packages, we have also started to refresh our package logos for each tool. You&amp;rsquo;ll notice them in the Kali Linux menu, as well as the tools page on &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/">GitLab&lt;/a> &lt;em>(more information on this coming soon!)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-2-release/images/release-2020.2-icons.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your tool has a logo and we have missed it, please let us know on the &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/bug_report_page.php">bug tracker&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="wslconf">WSLconf&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>WSLconf happened earlier this year, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/steevdave">@steev&lt;/a> gave a 35 minute talk on &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8m6tKErjAI">How We Use WSL at Kali&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;. Go check it out!&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="behind-the-scenes-infrastructure-improvements">Behind the Scenes, Infrastructure Improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have been celebrating the arrival of new servers, which over the last few weeks we have been migrating too. This includes a new ARM build server and what we use for &lt;a href="https://autopkgtest.kali.org/">package testing&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This may not be directly noticeable, but you may reap the benefits of it! If you are wanting to help out with Kali, we have added a new section to our documentation showing how to submit a &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/contributing-runtime-tests/">autopkgtest&lt;/a>. Feedback is welcome!&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="kali-nethunter">Kali NetHunter&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We were so excited about some of the work that has been happening with NetHunter recently, we already did a &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-nethunter-updates/">mid-term release&lt;/a> to showcase them and get it to you as quick as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of all the previous NetHunter news there is even more to announce this time around!&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Nexmon support has been revived, bringing WiFi monitor support and frame injection to &lt;code>wlan0&lt;/code> on the Nexus 6P, Nexus 5, Sony Xperia Z5 Compact, and more!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>OpenPlus 3T images have been added to the download page.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have crossed &lt;a href="https://kalilinux.gitlab.io/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-devices/nethunter-kernelstats.html">160 different kernels in our repository&lt;/a>, allowing NetHunter to &lt;a href="https://kalilinux.gitlab.io/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-devices/nethunter-kernels.html">support over 64 devices&lt;/a>! Yes, over 160 kernels and over 64 devices supported. Amazing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our documentation page has &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter/">received a well deserved refresh&lt;/a>, especially the kernel development section.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>One of the most common questions to come in about NetHunter is &amp;ldquo;What device should I run it on?&amp;rdquo;. Keep your &lt;a href="https://kalilinux.gitlab.io/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-devices/nethunter-images.html">eye on this page&lt;/a> to see what your options are on an automatically updated basis!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you think about the amount of power NetHunter provides in such a compact package, it really is mind blowing. Its been amazing to watch this progress, and the entire Kali team is excited to show you what is coming in the future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fresh images&lt;/strong>
So what are you waiting for? Start &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">downloading&lt;/a> already!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seasoned Kali users are already aware of this, but for the ones who are not, we do also produce &lt;a href="https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-weekly/">weekly builds&lt;/a> that you can use as well. If you can&amp;rsquo;t wait for our next release and you want the latest packages when you download the image, you can just use the weekly image instead. This way you&amp;rsquo;ll have fewer updates to do. &lt;em>Just know these are automated builds that we don&amp;rsquo;t QA like we do our standard release images&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Existing Upgrades&lt;/strong>
If you already have an existing Kali installation, remember you can always do a quick update:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ echo &amp;quot;deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib&amp;quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt -y full-upgrade
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo reboot -f
kali@kali:~$
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You should now be on Kali Linux 2020.2. We can do a quick check by doing:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">kali@kali:~$ grep VERSION /etc/os-release
VERSION=&amp;quot;2020.2&amp;quot;
VERSION_ID=&amp;quot;2020.2&amp;quot;

&lt;p>Massive thanks to our dedicated developers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kimocoder">@kimocoder&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PaulWebSec">@PaulWebSec&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simonpunk1">@simonpunk&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yesimxev">@yesimxev&lt;/a>, &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://github.com/johanlike">#DJY&lt;/a> who did an incredible job in bringing you the following highlights:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Monitor support for Qualcomm wifi chips in various snapdragon SOCs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New RTL88XXXU drivers with injection support&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New USB function management GUI for HID attacks and much more&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GitLab CI to dramatically speed up the release workflows&lt;/li>
&lt;li>NetHunter Kernel-Builder to simplify building custom kernels&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brand new NetHunter images for the following devices
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Nexus 6P with Android 8.1&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nexus 6P with LineageOS 17.1&lt;/li>
&lt;li>OnePlus 7 with Android 10&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Xiaomi Mi 9T with Miui 11&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="nexus-6p-images-for-android-81-and-lineageos-171">Nexus 6P images for Android 8.1 and LineageOS 17.1&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-nethunter-updates/images/NH-Release-2020.2-pre-05-nexus-6p.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>One of the most popular NetHunter devices has received a well deserved refresh.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have released two new images to provide support for:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Stock Android 8.1&lt;/li>
&lt;li>LineageOS 17.1 / PE 10&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Additional WiFi adaptors with injection support&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Both these images include updated kernels with the latest rtl88XXXu drivers from the legendary Kimocoder, adding injection support for:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>RTL8812AU&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RTL8814AU&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RTL8821AU&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-nethunter-updates/images/NH-Release-2020.2-pre-01-Angler-10-rtl8812au.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Android 8.1 image is considered the recommended release&lt;/strong> with a proven track record of supporting NetHunter under the most extreme conditions, including force encryption of the data partition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Considering the current maturity of Android 10 for this platform, we would consider this version to be most suited for those who love to experiment and don&amp;rsquo;t mind getting things working by themselves. We had to edit the vendor fstab file on a laptop to disable force encryption because TWRP didn&amp;rsquo;t support it at the time of writing. If that doesn&amp;rsquo;t scare you then this image might be just right for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both images are available for download on our &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-nethunter-download/">Kali NetHunter download page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="oneplus-7-t--pro-image-for-android-10">OnePlus 7 (T / Pro) image for Android 10&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-nethunter-updates/images/NH-Release-2020.2-pre-06-one-plus-7p.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our flagship device has received a new kernel for Android 10 based on the amazing work of the talented &lt;a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/m/tytydraco.8155542/">#tytydraco&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The image supports the following models in the series:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>OnePlus 7&lt;/li>
&lt;li>OnePlus 7 Pro&lt;/li>
&lt;li>OnePlus 7T&lt;/li>
&lt;li>OnePlus 7T Pro&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Please note that we do not currently recommend the OnePlus 7T and OnePlus 7T Pro until full TWRP recovery support is available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our pick is the OnePlus 7 for its incredible price performance ratio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new image offers all the usual bells and whistles you can expect from NetHunter but also has some improvements over the Android 9 version, such as:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Full support for USB multi-port adaptors (USB,HDMI, ethernet, pass-through charging, etc.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Full HID support&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The latest rtl88XXXu drivers from Kimocoder, adding injection support for:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>RTL8812AU&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RTL8814AU&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RTL8821AU&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The image is available for download on our &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-nethunter-download/">Kali NetHunter download page&lt;/a>.
Please note that Android 10 adds certain restrictions to the way storage access is handled. Please update the NetHunter app from the NetHunter store after flashing the image to enable the required access.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="xiaomi-mi-9t-image-for-android-10">Xiaomi Mi 9T image for Android 10&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-nethunter-updates/images/NH-Release-2020.2-pre-07-xiaomi-mi-9t.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are very excited to welcome our new favourite mid tier device. Sporting a Qualcomm SDM730 Snapdragon, 6GB RAM &amp;amp; 64GB /128GB it is a beast of a machine for under US$300! The miui interface is gorgeous especially when paired with the lawnchair 3 launcher but might not be everybody&amp;rsquo;s cup of tea. Luckily there are 3rd party ROMs available to suit everyone&amp;rsquo;s taste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just like its bigger brother, the OP7, this device includes all the bells and whistles:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Full support for USB multi-port adaptors (USB,HDMI, ethernet, pass-through charging, etc.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Full HID support&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The latest rtl88XXXu drivers from Kimocoder, adding injection support for:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>RTL8812AU&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RTL8814AU&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RTL8821AU&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Miui being a little bit eccentric, you might have to disable the &amp;ldquo;Privileged Extension&amp;rdquo; in the NetHunter store app under &amp;ldquo;Expert mode&amp;rdquo; if the store app fails to install applications. Other than that, this device is my personal favourite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The image is available for download on our &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-nethunter-download/">Kali NetHunter download page&lt;/a>. Please note that Android 10 adds certain restrictions to the way storage access is handled. Please update the NetHunter app from the NetHunter store after flashing the image to enable the required access.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="monitor-mode-for-internal-qcacld-wlan0-chips">Monitor mode for internal QCACLD wlan0 chips&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the past few months, various researchers and developers have independently discovered a little gem amongst all the commits to the Qualcomm qcacld-3.0 wifi driver in the Code Aurora Forum: &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/Codeaurora/platform_vendor_qcom-opensource_wlan_qcacld-3.0/-/commit/a307f63059c7fb5e89c12e057d80fe0948c11e3b">A patch to enable monitor mode&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of those researchers was our very own &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kimocoder">@kimocoder&lt;/a> who immediately mobilised &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simonpunk1">@simonpunk&lt;/a> &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://github.com/johanlike">#DJY&lt;/a> to develop kernel patches and NetHunter extensions to bring us that amazing feature within days of discovery. Outstanding work and we are incredibly proud of their achievement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both the OnePlus 7 and Xiaomi Mi 9T images fully support this feature. We also added custom commands to start / stop the monitor mode for wlan0:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-nethunter-updates/images/NH-Release-2020.2-pre-08-WLAN0-NetHunter.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are working tirelessly to roll out this kernel patch to other devices and we welcome everybody&amp;rsquo;s input. If you would like to develop a custom kernel for NetHunter, please keep reading about our new kernel-builder and join us in our &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/forumdisplay.php?35-App-Store">forums&lt;/a>. The more devices we can support the better and the more people involved the more fun we are all going to have.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="usb-arsenal-for-hid-attacks-and-more">USB Arsenal for HID attacks and more&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Newer Android kernels (4.x) no longer require patches to add Human Interface Device (HID) gadget mode to our devices, which is required for rubber ducky style USB attacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>HID gadget mode is now fully supported by default but has to be enabled and configured via userspace controls. We have implemented a two tier USB gadget mode control centre:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>NetHunter kernel packages can install custom init.rc files with device specific USB gadget mode controls&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>NetHunter app developer extraordinaire &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simonpunk1">@simonpunk&lt;/a> has developed a menu for the NetHunter app called &amp;ldquo;USB Arsenal&amp;rdquo;, which can either trigger the functions defined in the init.rc, or - if no device specific init.rc exists - allows you to configure your own gadget mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-nethunter-updates/images/NH-Release-2020.2-pre-04a-USB-Arsenal1.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But he didn&amp;rsquo;t stop there. The USB Arsenal also allows you to mount images (img and iso) and to provide them as a mass storage device to target machines as if it were a USB stick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-nethunter-updates/images/NH-Release-2020.2-pre-04b-USB-Arsenal2.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that, the USB Arsenal provides a menu to set up USB network tethering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-nethunter-updates/images/NH-Release-2020.2-pre-04c-USB-Arsenal3.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are incredibly excited about the US Arsenal and will dedicate an entire article about this useful application in the near future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="nethunter-kernel-builder">NetHunter Kernel Builder&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are providing three different editions of Kali NetHunter:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Kali NetHunter rootless, which delivers over 85% of Kali NetHunter functionality to Android devices without the need to root the device or install a custom recovery&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kali NetHunter light, which delivers over 95% of Kali NetHunter functionality to devices that are rooted and have a custom recovery but for which no NetHunter kernel exists (yet)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kali NetHunter, which delivers 100% but requires a rooted device with a custom recovery and a kernel that has been custom built for NetHunter&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Building a custom kernel for NetHunter is not black magic but is does require experimentation, patience, resilience and a lot of time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;or it used to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have created the NetHunter Kernel-Builder. A one stop shop to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Download and setup the toolchains required by your particular kernel&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provide over &lt;a href="https://images.kali.org/nethunter/toolchains/">ten different prebuilt toilchains&lt;/a> to cater for everybody&amp;rsquo;s needs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a NetHunter kernel config&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Patch the kernel with standard and device specific patches from a central repository&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Build the kernel&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create anykernel zip to test the kernel (full functionality requires a NetHunter image or kernel package)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a zip file to extract in the nethunter-installer folder to build nethunter images&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We have been using the Kernel-Builder to build the kernels for all devices on this page and it saved us over 75% of the time it would have taken us in the past.
We have added example config files that allows you to compile the kernels for the devices on this page and you can use them as a guide to build a kernel for your own device.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Kernel-Builder is a great tool to simplify and automate and whilst it is also ideal to learn about Android kernel building, it requires skills to build kernels and it takes time to master those skills. The Kernel-Builder will help freeing that time by eliminating repetitive and redundant tasks and documentations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the topic of documentation; the documentation for the kernel builder is yet to be completed but we plan to finish that within 7 days of this blog post going up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please check out the kernel-builder repo and join us in our &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/forumdisplay.php?35-App-Store">forums&lt;/a> if you are interested in building NetHunter kernels. We&amp;rsquo;d love to have you on board.&lt;/p>

We made some major changes to the installers, and some people had a few issues with some of the images we released. So, we made some slight alternations to smooth things out and make the install process easier for everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="base-image">Base Image&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before, we used to release multiple separate installers for different Desktop Environments (DE). With 2020.1 we changed how we distributed our base images, without having multiple different ISOs for each DE, by introducing a &amp;ldquo;installer&amp;rdquo; image as well as a &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both accomplish the same thing, but how they do it is different. The &amp;ldquo;installer&amp;rdquo; image is the new one, as this uses &amp;ldquo;debian-cd&amp;rdquo; on the back-end. We noticed &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=6053">a bug&lt;/a> in a dependency chain, which caused an issue with x11. As a result, you may not have got a graphical interface after installing Kali. As a result, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">we pushed out a fix (2020.1a)&lt;/a> to address this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note: If you are already running 2020.1, you do not need to reinstall. The 2020.1a release is only for those who weren&amp;rsquo;t able to successfully install 2020.1&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1a-release/images/raspberry-pi.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have also pushed out an updated image, both 32-bit and 64-bit for &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/">Raspberry Pi&lt;/a>, due to some files being corrupt in the initial image.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="vagrant">Vagrant&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1a-release/images/VAGRANT_CLOUD.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the introduction of a &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-default-non-root-user/">non-root user&lt;/a>, we have switched the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/introduction/default-credentials/">default user&lt;/a> to be &lt;code>kali&lt;/code>. We also moved the &lt;a href="https://app.vagrantup.com/kalilinux/boxes/rolling">vagrant image&lt;/a> to this user as well. However, we &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-vagrant/-/issues/1/">reverted it back&lt;/a> to &lt;code>vagrant&lt;/code> to be more in line with their best practices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not long after this fix, we have received &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-vagrant/-/merge_requests/1">a contribution&lt;/a> to fix a bug that would occur if you defined an additional network inteface in the Vagrantfile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find both of those fixes in the latest version of the Vagrant box (2020.1.2).&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="pinebook-pro">PineBook Pro&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1a-release/images/kali-pinebook-pro.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have got Kali Linux running on a PineBook Pro! Please &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/">download a copy&lt;/a> and try it out if you have a PineBook! If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what the PineBook is, &lt;a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/">check it out!&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thanks to everyone who reported an issue on the bug tracker (Sorry, twitter doesn&amp;rsquo;t count). Keep them coming so we can make 2020.2 even stronger!&lt;/p>

We have the goal to make Kali as easily available to you as possible, so you always have access to it whenever you may need it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After all, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kalilinux/status/1229906554079645696">Kali is for the children&lt;/a>. ð&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-linux-lxc--lxd-images-released">Kali Linux LXC / LXD Images Released&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Thanks to the awesome people maintaining the &lt;a href="https://us.images.linuxcontainers.org/">Linux Image Server for LXC and LXD&lt;/a>, our Kali Linux container images are now available for easy installation using LXD or LXC. If you are already running Kali Linux but need to protect your machine from yourself whilst reversing that funky malware you just discovered, or you got issued a work laptop running Ubuntu but you really crave a bit of Kali power then Linux Containers are the perfect solution for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="linux-containers-are-amazing">Linux Containers are Amazing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Figuring out how to use LXD was as simple as &lt;a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/try-it/">trying it out online&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We quickly adopted Linux Containers as our go-to solution for reversing, developing, packaging, testing&amp;hellip; well pretty much for all the tasks that requires us to protect our production equipment from ourselves. Linux Containers are a great alternative to Virtual Machines, without the overhead. They are as awesome as docker containers but for entire systems, not just for single applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We personally recommend using LXD on Ubuntu and LXC on other Linux distributions but that is purely personal preference as that is what is natively supported by those systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have published a dedicated page in our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/containers/kalilinux-lxc-images/">Kali Linux Documentation site&lt;/a> with step-by-step guides on how to install containers in the following scenarios:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Kali Linux LXD container on Ubuntu host for running command line applications&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kali Linux LXD container on Ubuntu host for running GUI applications&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kali Linux LXC privileged container on Kali host&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kali Linux LXC unprivileged container on Kali host&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s see how easy it is to launch a Kali LXD container image in Ubuntu:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-a-kali-linux-lxd-image-in-ubuntu">Setting up a Kali Linux LXD Image in Ubuntu&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Obviously, to get this running, you need LXD installed. In Ubuntu we can install LXD as a snap package. Once installed we launch a Kali Linux container image, install some additional packages and create a non-root user. The whole procedure should only take a few minutes before we can log in.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">## Install LXD
sudo snap install lxd
lxd init
## Launch the container
lxc launch images:kali/current/amd64 my-kali
## Install some additional applications, use either light or default
lxc exec my-kali -- passwd ## First things first
lxc exec my-kali -- apt install kali-linux-light ## Bare minimum
lxc exec my-kali -- apt install kali-linux-default ## Default set of packages
## Setup non-root user
lxc exec my-kali -- adduser kali
lxc exec my-kali -- usermod -aG sudo kali
lxc exec my-kali -- sed -i '1 i\TERM=xterm-256color' /home/kali/.bashrc
lxc exec my-kali -- sh -c &amp;quot;echo 'Set disable_coredump false' &amp;gt; /etc/sudo.conf&amp;quot;
## Login
lxc console my-kali
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-everywhere/images/LXD-055_Ubuntu_KaliCliSession_DE.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Voila! That&amp;rsquo;s all there is to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can even run GUI applications from the LXD container but that requires a few more steps to set up, as detailed in our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/containers/kalilinux-lxc-images/">Documentation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-everywhere/images/LXD-090_Ubuntu_KaliGuiSession.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Running an unprivileged Kali Linux container on a Kali host using LXC might not look as dramatic but is just as useful:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-everywhere/images/LXD-100_Kali_UnPrivSession.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have fun with your Kali LXC / LXD images!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux 2020.1 Release (Non-Root, Single Installer &amp; NetHunter Rootless)</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1-release/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1-release/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1-release/images/kali-2020.1.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>We are here to kick off our first release of the decade, with Kali Linux 2020.1! Available for immediate &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">download&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following is a brief feature summary for this release:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-default-non-root-user/">Non-Root by default&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kali single installer image&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter/nethunter-rootless/">Kali NetHunter Rootless&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improvements to theme &amp;amp; kali-undercover&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New tools&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="non-root">Non-Root&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Throughout the history of Kali (and its &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/introduction/kali-linux-history/">predecessors&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.backtrack-linux.org/">BackTrack&lt;/a>, WHAX, and Whoppix), the default credentials have been &lt;code>root/toor&lt;/code>. This is no more. We are no longer using the superuser account, root, as default in Kali 2020.1. The default user account is now a &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/policy/kali-linux-user-policy/">standard, unprivileged, user&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more of the reasons behind this switch, please see our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-default-non-root-user/">previous blog post&lt;/a>. As you can imagine, this is a very large change, with years of history behind it. As a result, if you notice any issues with this, please do let us know on the &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">bug tracker&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>root/toor&lt;/code> is dead. Long live &lt;code>kali/kali&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1-release/images/kali-kali-login.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="kali-as-your-main-os">Kali as your Main OS&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>So with this, should you use Kali as your daily driver, as the primary OS? It&amp;rsquo;s up to you.
There wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything really stopping you before, we just don&amp;rsquo;t encourage it. We still don&amp;rsquo;t. But its a helping hand for the people who are familiar with Kali enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why do we not recommend it?
Because we are unable to test for that usage pattern and we donât want the influx of bug reports that would come with it.
If you are brave enough to try it, you may wish to switch the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/kali-branches/">branch from &amp;ldquo;rolling&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;kali-last-snapshot&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> to try and be more stable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-single-installer-image">Kali Single Installer Image&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We took a good hard look at the usage of Kali, what images are actually downloaded, how they are put to use, and so on. With this information in hand, we decided to completely restructure and simplify the images we release. Going forward, we will have an installer image, a live image, and a network installer image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These changes should allow for easier selection of the right image for you to download, while increasing flexibility on installation and further reducing download sizes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Our Installer Image&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This is what we recommend for most users that want to install Kali on their system&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Doesn&amp;rsquo;t require a network connection (aka offline install) for the default package selection&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Able to select desktop environment to install (Previously there was a separate image for each DE: XFCE, GNOME, KDE, etc.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Able to select tools to install at install time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can&amp;rsquo;t be used to boot a live system. This is just an installer image.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Filename:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>kali-linux-2020.1-installer-&amp;lt;amd64|i386&amp;gt;.iso&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We are no longer offering separate images for every desktop environment (DE). Instead, we now have a single image with the option to pick your DE during installation. This means there isn&amp;rsquo;t a download link for Xfce (which is our default option since &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/">2019.4&lt;/a>), GNOME, KDE, MATE or LXDE DEs. Just one image to rule them all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At install time, you may &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/">select the tools included&lt;/a> with Kali (or &lt;strong>none at all&lt;/strong>)! This gives you more control over what &lt;strong>you&lt;/strong> want. We understand that Kali comes with more tools than some people use, or they have their own select tools they use. Now they can install Kali without any metapackages, giving them a bare Kali installation, so they can &lt;strong>individually select what tools they want&lt;/strong> (rather than groups/).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The default image contains the &lt;code>kali-desktop-xfce&lt;/code> and &lt;code>kali-tools-default&lt;/code> packages, allowing for an offline installation of Kali (as it always has been). Selecting any non-default tools will require a network connection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: &amp;ldquo;Kali Live&amp;rdquo; is not included in this image. If you wish to use live mode, you&amp;rsquo;ll need the live image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1-release/images/tasksel_first_0.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Network Install Image&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Smallest image to download&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This requires a network connection to install&lt;/li>
&lt;li>During setup, it will download the latest packages every time it&amp;rsquo;s used&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Able to select desktop environment to install&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Able to select tools to install&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can&amp;rsquo;t be used to boot a live system. This is just an installer image.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Filename:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>kali-linux-2020.1-installer-netinst-&amp;lt;amd64|i386&amp;gt;.iso&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a very small image, containing only enough to install the base system, but behaving exactly like the full installer image, allowing you to install everything that Kali offers, provided that you have enabled network connectivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Live Image&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Its primary use is to be able to run Kali, without installing it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>But it also contains an installer, behaving like the &amp;ldquo;Network Install Image&amp;rdquo; described above&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Filename:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>kali-linux-2020.1-live-&amp;lt;amd64|i386&amp;gt;.iso&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Kali Live&amp;rdquo; hasn&amp;rsquo;t been forgotten about - it&amp;rsquo;s just moved to its own image. This allows you to try Kali without installing it and is perfect for running off a USB stick. You can install from this image, however, it will require a network connection (this is why we suggest the stand-alone install image for most users).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alternatively, you can &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/dojo-mastering-live-build/">generate your own image&lt;/a>, in particular if you want to use another desktop environment instead of our default Xfce. It&amp;rsquo;s not as hard as it sounds!.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="arm-images">ARM Images&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You will probably notice a bit of a change in the ARM images starting with our 2020.1 release. There are fewer images available for download, due to both manpower and hardware constraints, some images won&amp;rsquo;t be posted without community assistance.
The scripts are still updated, so if an image doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist for a machine you use, you will have to create it by running the &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm">build script&lt;/a> on a Kali machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ARM images for 2020.1 will still run as root by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sad news that a lot of people didn&amp;rsquo;t want to hear&amp;hellip; an image for the Pinebook Pro isn&amp;rsquo;t included in the 2020.1 release. We are still working on getting it added, and as soon as it is ready we will post it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="nethunter-images">NetHunter Images&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our mobile pen-testing platform, Kali NetHunter, has also had some new improvements. You are now no longer required to root your phone in order to run Kali NetHunter, but that does come with some limitations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To suit everybody&amp;rsquo;s needs, Kali NetHunter now comes in the following three editions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>NetHunter&lt;/strong> - Needs rooted devices with custom recovery and patched kernel. Has no restrictions. Device specific images are available &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-nethunter-download/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>NetHunter Light&lt;/strong> - Needs rooted devices with custom recovery but no custom kernel. Has minor restrictions, i.e. no WiFi injection or HID support. Architecture specific images are available &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-nethunter-download/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>NetHunter Rootless&lt;/strong> - Installable on all stock standard, unmodified devices using Termux. Some limitations, like lack of db support in Metasploit and no root permissions. Installation instruction is available &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter/nethunter-rootless/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter/#1-0-nethunter-editions/">NetHunter documentation page&lt;/a> includes a more detailed comparison. Each NetHunter edition comes with both the new &amp;ldquo;kali&amp;rdquo; user as well as root. KeX now supports multiple sessions so you can opt to run your pentest in one whilst writing a report in another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please note that due to how Samsung Galaxy devices function, the non-root user might not be able to run &lt;code>sudo&lt;/code> but has to use &lt;code>su -c&lt;/code> instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the peculiarities of the new &amp;ldquo;NetHunter Rootless&amp;rdquo; edition is that the default non-root user has almost full privileges in the chroot due to how proot containers work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1-release/images/release-2020.1-nethunter1-scaled.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="theming">Theming&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With our last release, we made a major change switching from GNOME to Xfce. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t the end for us; we have kept on going with the design work, and have more updates:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>GNOME&lt;/strong> There is now a new theme for GNOME users and as an additional bonus, there is a light and dark theme!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1-release/images/release-2020.1-gnome-shell-overview.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1-release/images/release-2020.1-gnome-shell-light.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1-release/images/release-2020.1-gnome-shell-dark.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Tools&lt;/strong> We are giving the tools that you are very fond of a makeover too! We are slowly working through our collection, refreshing them and adding in new icons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1-release/images/release-2020.1-icons.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Menu&lt;/strong> Eagle-eyed users may also notice the icons used in the menu have also been replaced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1-release/images/release-2020.1-menu.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Setup&lt;/strong> And if you opt to use the graphical installer of Kali, it&amp;rsquo;s also been updated &lt;em>(Before and after shots)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1-release/images/release-2020.1-setup.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-undercover">Kali-Undercover&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We were not expecting the community&amp;rsquo;s overwhelming response to kali-undercover. So carrying on from &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/">Kali 2019.4 release&lt;/a>, Kali-undercover now starts to feel even more like Windows to help blend in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2020-1-release/images/release-2020.1-undercover.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-packages">New Packages&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Kali Linux is a rolling distribution, so it gets updates as soon as they are available, rather than waiting for &amp;ldquo;the next release&amp;rdquo;. So since the last release, we have the normal tool upgrades as well as a few new tools added, such as: &lt;code>cloud-enum&lt;/code>, &lt;code>emailharvester&lt;/code>, &lt;code>phpggc&lt;/code>, &lt;code>sherlock&lt;/code>, &lt;code>splinter&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have a few new (&lt;code>kali-community-wallpapers&lt;/code>) and old (&lt;code>kali-legacy-wallpapers&lt;/code>) wallpapers to offer up if you want to customize or are feeling a little a little nostalgic.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="python-2-end-of-life">Python 2 End Of Life&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a reminder, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/python-2-end-of-life/">Python 2 has reached &amp;ldquo;end of life&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> on the 1st of January 2020. What this means is, we are removing tools that depend on Python 2. Why? Because they are no longer being maintained, they are not receiving updates, and they need replacing. The pentesting landscape is a dynamic field that is forever changing. It&amp;rsquo;s time to keep up. We will be doing our best to find alternatives that are actively worked upon.&lt;/p>

As part of our evaluation of &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/">Kali tools&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/policy/">policies&lt;/a> we have decided to change this and move Kali to a &amp;ldquo;traditional default non-root user&amp;rdquo; model. This change will be part of the 2020.1 release, currently scheduled for late January. However, you will notice this change in the &lt;a href="https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-weekly/">weekly images&lt;/a> starting now.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-history-of-default-root-user">The History of Default Root User&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the beginning, there was &lt;a href="https://www.backtrack-linux.org/">BackTrack&lt;/a>. In its original form, BackTrack (v1-4) was a Slackware live based distro intended to be ran from a CDROM. Yes, we do go back a ways &lt;em>(2006!)&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this model, there was no real update mechanism, just a bunch of pentesting tools living in the &lt;code>/pentest/&lt;/code> directory, that you could use as part of assessments. It was the early days, so things were not very sophisticated, we were just all happy things worked. A lot of those tools back then either required root access to run or ran better when ran as root. With this operating system that would be ran from a CD, never be updated, and had a lot of tools that needed root access to run it was a simple decision to have a &amp;ldquo;everything as root&amp;rdquo; security model. It made complete sense for the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As time went by however, there were a number of changes. All of us that were around back then sort of remember things a little differently but on the broad strokes we saw people were installing BackTrack on bare metal so we felt like there should be an update mechanism. Especially after walking around Defcon and noticing how many people were using a version of BackTrack that was vulnerable to a certain exploit which came out a few weeks prior. That moved us to basing BackTrack 5 off of Ubuntu instead of Slackware live &lt;em>(February 2011)&lt;/em>. Then as more time went by we were so busy fighting with Ubuntu that we felt like we needed to move onto something else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That brought us to &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-0-release/">Kali&lt;/a> &lt;em>(March 2013)&lt;/em>, and being an official &lt;a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census/Kali">Debian derivative&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="modern-kali">Modern Kali&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our move to be a Debian derivative brought with a whole host of advantages. So many in-fact its not worth reviewing them here, just look at the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-whats-new/">early&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/bleeding-edge-kali-repositories/">Kali&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-3-release/">blog&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-penetration-testing-platform/">posts&lt;/a> shortly after the launch and you will see a ton of &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/tracking-fixing-installer-bugs/">examples&lt;/a>. But one advantage that we never really talked to much about is the fact that we are based on &lt;a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting">Debian-Testing&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Debian has a well earned reputation for being one of the most stable Linux distros out there. Debian-Testing is the development branch of the next version of Debian, and realistically is still more stable than many mainstream Linux distros.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While we don&amp;rsquo;t encourage people to run Kali as their day to day operating system, over the last few years more and more users have started to do so &lt;em>(even if they are not using it to do penetration testing full time)&lt;/em>, including some members of the Kali development team. When people do so, they obviously don&amp;rsquo;t run as default root user. With this usage over time, there is the obvious conclusion that default root user is no longer necessary and Kali will be better off moving to a more traditional security model.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-some-tools-require-root-access">Why Some Tools Require Root Access&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Lets have a quick sidebar and review how some tools require root. For this, we will pick on &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/nmap/">nmap&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nmap is hands down the most popular portscanner in use today, and one of the most popular tools used on Kali. When ran by a non-root user doing a standard scan, nmap will default to running what is known as a connect scan (&lt;code>-sT&lt;/code>). In this sort of scan, a full TCP three way handshake is conducted to identify if a given port is open or not. However, when ran as a root user nmap takes advantage of the additional privileges to utilize &lt;a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/raw.7.html">raw sockets&lt;/a> and will conduct a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_scanner#SYN_scanning">syn scan&lt;/a> (&lt;code>-sS&lt;/code>), a far more popular scan type. This syn scan is not possible unless ran as root.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This aspect of security tools requiring root level permissions traditionally has not been uncommon. Running as a root user by default makes it easier to use these tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the, possibly surprising, conclusions we came to while looking at this issue is the number of tools that require root access has dropped over the years. This has made this default root policy less useful, bringing us to the point now where we are going to make this change.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="many-applications-require-non-root-accounts">Many Applications Require Non Root Accounts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On the opposite direction, over the years a number of applications and services have been configured to forbid their usage as the &lt;code>root&lt;/code> user. This has become either a maintenance burden for us (when we opted to patch out the check or reconfigure the service) or a nuisance for users that could not use their application (with &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=5404">chrome/chromium&lt;/a> being a well known case).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dropping this default root policy will thus simplify maintenance of Kali and will avoid problems for end-users.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-non-root-user-implementation">Kali Non-Root User Implementation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are a number of changes you can expect to see as part of this change.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Kali in live mode will be running as user &lt;code>kali&lt;/code> password &lt;code>kali&lt;/code>. No more &lt;code>root&lt;/code>/&lt;code>toor&lt;/code>. (Get ready to set up your IDS filters, as we are sure this user/pass combo will be being scanned for by bots everywhere soon).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On install, Kali will prompt you to create a non-root user that will have administrative privileges (due to its addition to the &lt;code>sudo&lt;/code> group). This is the same process as other Linux distros you may be familiar with.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tools that we identify as needing root access, as well as common administrative functions such as starting/stopping services, will interactively ask for administrative privileges (at least when started from the Kali menu). If you really don&amp;rsquo;t care about security, and if you preferred the old model, you can install kali-grant-root and run &lt;code>dpkg-reconfigure kali-grant-root&lt;/code> to configure password-less root rights.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>All-in-all, we don&amp;rsquo;t expect this will be a major change for most users. It is possible that some tools or administrative functions will be missed in our review, when that happens we would ask that you create a &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">bug report&lt;/a> so it can be tracked and corrected. (And no, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kalilinux">tweeting&lt;/a> at us is not a bug report and won&amp;rsquo;t be tracked. Sorry, but that just does not scale).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="going-forward">Going Forward&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>All that said, we are still not encouraging people to use Kali as their day to day operating system. More than anything else, this is because we don&amp;rsquo;t test for that usage pattern and we don&amp;rsquo;t want the influx of bug reports that would come with it. However, for those of you that are familiar with Kali and want to run it as your day to day platform, this change should help you out a lot. For the rest of you, this should give you a better security model to operate under while you are doing assessments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we mentioned at the start, this change is currently available in the daily builds and will be in the next weekly build. Feel free to download and test early, as we would like to have as many potential issues shaken lose before release as possible. The more active users on this the better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a strong 2019 with Kali, this is a major change to start out our 2020 development cycle. Expect more as the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-roadmap-2019-2020/">year goes on&lt;/a>.

For a long time, nobody cared and Python 3 adoption was slow. But things have changed a lot lately as the deadline is right around the corner (1st January).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="debian-is-removing-python-2-support">Debian is removing Python 2 support&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Debian is planning to get rid of &lt;a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Python/2Removal">Python 2 entirely for their next stable release&lt;/a> so they are progressively getting rid of Python 2 code. They filed release critical bugs on leaf packages (i.e. packages without reverse dependencies) asking them to be ported to Python 3. If the Python 3 port is not happening soon enough, these packages will be removed from &lt;a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting">Debian Testing&lt;/a> &lt;em>(which is what Kali is based on)&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="consequences-for-kali">Consequences for Kali&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="applications-disappearing">Applications disappearing&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As Kali is a rolling distribution, it continuously receives updates from Debian Testing. This includes when packages &amp;ldquo;go away&amp;rdquo; because they have been dropped from Debian. However, they can always come back later, provided that someone ports them to Python 3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have already experienced this in the case of &lt;code>zenmap&lt;/code> which is no longer maintained by the &lt;a href="https://nmap.org/zenmap/">nmap developers&lt;/a>. Thus, it&amp;rsquo;s no longer built by &lt;a href="https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=zenmap">Debian&amp;rsquo;s nmap source&lt;/a> package, and as a result no longer appears in Kali.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="broken-applications">Broken applications&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We have many Python 2 applications in Kali that use modules which are packaged in Debian. When Debian drops the Python 2 version of such a module, the application is broken in &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/kali-linux-sources-list-repositories/">kali-dev&lt;/a>. kali-rolling is not affected due to the way it&amp;rsquo;s managed but the growing divergence between kali-dev and kali-rolling is making our job more difficult: we don&amp;rsquo;t get updates for such packages and there are other (recent/) applications that will likely require new versions of those packages!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-must-remove-python-2-code-too">Kali must remove Python 2 code too&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Due to this change in the ecosystem, Kali has no other choice than to follow Debian&amp;rsquo;s lead and remove Python 2 code as well. This giant effort is tracked with &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/kalilinux/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Project%3A%3APy2Removal">many GitLab issues&lt;/a> against all packages depending on Python 2 in some way. We have already filed upstream bug reports for all the packages where there&amp;rsquo;s no Python 3 support yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How we handle each case depends on many factors:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If upstream is working on Python 3 support, then we just wait until it&amp;rsquo;s ready.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If upstream is inactive or is not interested into porting its code to Python 3, then we have few choices:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>either we remove the package;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>or we find some fork/patch that adds Python 3 support;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>or we do the porting work ourselves (rather unlikely except for trivial scripts).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It also depends on the kind of packages:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For a Python library, it&amp;rsquo;s a two step process: first we add Python 3 support; Python 2 support is removed later, once all reverse dependencies have been updated to use Python 3.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For a Python application, a single update might be enough but that update might depend on having dependencies be ported to Python 3 first.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We don&amp;rsquo;t like to remove software, but sometimes when they are no longer maintained, we have no other choices. For important packages, we are waiting longer thus letting more time for the community to add the required Python 3 support. We might even patch them so that they display a warning inviting users to contribute, or at least understand the application may be removed in the near future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For packages that no longer add much value, or that have viable alternatives in Kali, we might remove them at any point in time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-you-can-contribute">How you can contribute&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If one of your favorite applications appears among the &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/kalilinux/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Project%3A%3APy2Removal">affected Kali packages&lt;/a> or among the &lt;a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=py2removal;users=debian-python@lists.debian.org;maint=team%2Bpkg-security@tracker.debian.org">affected packages from Debian&amp;rsquo;s pkg-security team&lt;/a>, then you should review its situation and possibly help the upstream developer(s) by submitting a pull request adding Python 3 support. Even if upstream is not very active, we will be able to merge your changes in Kali and keep the package for longer until upstream becomes active again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t have the coding skills required for this, you can still try to find a Python 3 fork/patch written by someone else and point it out to us in the corresponding GitLab issue or Debian bug report. Or, tell the developers how much you like their application and that you would like to continue to make use of it, so they should port over to Python 3.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux 2019.4 Release (Xfce, Gnome, GTK3, Kali-Undercover, Kali-Docs, KeX, PowerShell &amp; Public Packaging)</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/images/kali-2019.4-release.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>Time to grab yourself a drink, this will take a while!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/images/kali-preview-boot.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are incredibly excited to announce our fourth and final release of 2019, Kali Linux 2019.4, which is available immediately for &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">download&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2019.4 includes some exciting new updates:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A new default desktop environment, Xfce&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New GTK3 theme (for Gnome and Xfce)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introduction of &amp;ldquo;Kali Undercover&amp;rdquo; mode&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kali Documentation has a new home and is now Git powered&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Public Packaging - getting your tools into Kali&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kali NetHunter KeX - Full Kali desktop on Android&lt;/li>
&lt;li>BTRFS during setup&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added PowerShell&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/linux">kernel is upgraded to version 5.3.9&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;hellip; Plus the normal bugs fixes and updates.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="new-desktop-environment-and-gtk3-theme">New Desktop Environment and GTK3 Theme&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There are a ton of updates to go over for this release, but the most in your face item that everyone is going to notice first are the changes to the desktop environment and theme. So let&amp;rsquo;s cover that first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An update to the desktop environment has been a long time coming. We have been talking about how to address this, what we wanted to do, experimenting on different approaches, and so on for months now. As a summary we had a few issues we wanted to address head-on:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Performance issues - Gnome is a fully-featured desktop environment with a ton of awesome things it can do. But all these features comes with overhead, often overhead that is not useful for a distribution like Kali. We wanted to speed things up, and have a desktop environment that does only what it&amp;rsquo;s needed for, and nothing else. Gnome has been overkill for most Kali users, as many just want a window manager that allows you to run multiple terminal windows at once, and a web browser.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fractured user experience - We support a range of hardware, from the very high end to the very low. Because of this, traditionally our lower-end ARM builds have had a completely different UI than our standard. That&amp;rsquo;s not optimal, and we wanted to unify this experience so it did not matter if you were running on a bare metal install on a high end laptop or using a Raspberry Pi, the UI should be the same.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Modern look - We have been using the same UI for quite a while now, and our old theme maintainer had moved on due to lack of time. So we wanted to go with something fresh, new, and modern.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>To help us address these items, we tracked down &lt;a href="https://drasite.com/">Daniel Ruiz de AlegrÃ­a&lt;/a> and started the development of a new theme running on Xfce. Why Xfce? After reviewing the above issues, we felt that Xfce addressed them best while still being accessible to the majority of users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The solution we&amp;rsquo;ve committed to is lightweight and can run on all levels of Kali installs. It is functional in that it handles the various needs of the average user with no changes. It is approachable where it uses standard UI concepts we are all familiar with to ensure there is no learning curve. And it looks great with modern UI elements that make efficient use of screen space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are really excited about this UI update, and we think you are going to love it. However, as UI can be a bit like religion, if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to leave Gnome don&amp;rsquo;t worry. We still have a Gnome build for you, with a few changes already in place. As time goes by, we will be making changes to all of the desktop environments we release installs to get them &amp;ldquo;close&amp;rdquo; to a similar user experience no matter what DE you run. There will be limits to this, as we don&amp;rsquo;t have the resources to heavily invest in tweaking all these different environments. So if there is something you would like to see, feel free to submit a &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">feature request&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have also released a FAQ about the new theme that you can find on our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/xfce-faq/">docs page&lt;/a>. This includes some common items like how to switch to the theme on your existing install, how to change off of it if you don&amp;rsquo;t like it, and so on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="kali-undercover">Kali Undercover&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>With the change to the environment, we thought we would take a side step and do something fun. Thanks to Robert, who leads our penetration testing team, for suggesting a Kali theme that looks like Windows to the casual view, we have created the Kali Undercover theme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/images/kali-undercover-1.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Say you are working in a public place, hacking away, and you might not want the distinctive Kali dragon for everyone to see and wonder what it is you are doing. So, we made a little script that will change your Kali theme to look like a default Windows installation. That way, you can work a bit more incognito. After you are done and in a more private place, run the script again and you switch back to your Kali theme. Like magic!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="kali-docs-is-now-on-markdown-and-new-home-docs">Kali-Docs is now on Markdown and new home (/docs/)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This may not be as flashy as the new theme, but the changes to the documentation we have done is just as significant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of our go-forward goals with Kali is to move more of the development into the public and make it as easy as possible for anyone &lt;em>(that means you!)&lt;/em> to get &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/community/contribute/">involved and contribute&lt;/a> to Kali. That&amp;rsquo;s what our move to GitLab &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-roadmap-2019-2020/">earlier in the year&lt;/a> was all about. Another part of this is changing how we deal with docs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have since moved all of our documentation into Markdown in a &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/documentation/kali-docs">public Git repository&lt;/a>. From here on out anyone, not just Kali staff, can contribute to better documentation through merge requests. We will still approve any content changes, but once merged, changes will be automatically available on the docs section of our website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We encourage everyone to get involved! If you see something wrong in the existing docs, change it! If you have an idea for new docs, write it! These sorts of contributions make Kali better for everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is just the first step. With this change in place, coming soon watch for a Kali-Docs package in Kali that gives you full offline access to the documentation on every install of Kali. Perfect for those situations where you are working in a closed-off environment with no Internet access.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="public-packaging">Public Packaging&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One of the more significant new documents we have done is &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/public-packaging/">documenting how you can make a new package&lt;/a> that will get included in Kali.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most common bug reports is requests for us to add new tools or update existing ones. Oftentimes, by the tool developers themselves as they recognize that having their tool in the Kali repo is the easiest distribution channel for security assessment tools there is. The volume of this has always been difficult to keep up with, and we have to make some hard decisions on where to commit our limited resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now with this work-flow in place and documented, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait on us. Go ahead and package up your tool and submit it off to us for approval. This is an awesome way to get involved with improving Kali.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="btrfs-during-setup">BTRFS during setup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Another significant new addition to the documentation is the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/btrfs/">use of BTRFS as your root file system&lt;/a>. This is an amazing approach documented by Re4son, that when done gives you the ability to do file system rollbacks after upgrades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you are in a VM and about to try something new, you will often take a snapshot in case things go wrong you can easily go back to a known-good state. However, when you run Kali bare metal that&amp;rsquo;s not so easy. So you end up being extra careful, or if things go wrong have a lot of manual clean up to do. With BTRFS, you have this same snapshot capability on a bare metal install!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As this is new, it&amp;rsquo;s not integrated into our installer yet. Once we get some feedback on how it&amp;rsquo;s working for everyone, the next step is to streamline this and make it an easier option in our installer. So if you try it out, be sure to let us know how it works for you!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="powershell">PowerShell&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>On to other features, in case you missed it PowerShell is now in Kali. This has been really great to bring the ability to execute PowerShell scripts directly on Kali.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/images/power-shell-1-1.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/images/kali-pwsh-powershell-1.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="nethunter-kex---full-kali-desktop-on-android-phones">NetHunter Kex - Full Kali Desktop on Android phones&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Another feature we are super excited about is the introduction of NetHunter Kex. In a nutshell, this allows you to attach your Android device to an HDMI output along with Bluetooth keyboard and mouse and get a full, no compromise, Kali desktop. Yes. From your phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-4-release/images/kali-kex-theme.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had a live &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/">Penetration Testing with Kali&lt;/a> course we were teaching, and NetHunter Kex was just in a beta stage. So we wanted to really push the limits. So, in the live course, what we did was attach a USB-C hub to our OnePlus7. This gave us HDMI and Ethernet access. We attached the HDMI to the projector and used a bluetooth keyboard/mouse. With this, we were able to do an entire PWK module from the phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a feature you have to see to believe. Until you experience it, you won&amp;rsquo;t fully understand what this provides. With a strong enough phone, this is very similar to using a nice full-featured portable ARM desktop that happens to fit in your pocket. The possible ways you can leverage this in assessments is huge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get a full breakdown on how to use NetHunter Kex, check out our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter/nethunter-kex-manager/">docs at&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="arm">ARM&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2019.4 is the last release that will support 8GB sdcards on ARM. Starting in 2020.1, a 16GB sdcard will be the minimum we support. You will always be able to create your own image that supports smaller cards if you desire.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>RaspberryPi kernel was updated to 4.19.81, and the firmware package was updated to include the eeprom updates for the RaspberryPi 4.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>During the release testing, a limited number of devices were not showing the Kali menu properly. This was not critical enough to delay the release, so instead as a work-around you can run the following command to display the menu correctly:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt dist-upgrade
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Once this completes, log out, so you&amp;rsquo;re back at the login manager. Then switch to a console via CTRL+ALT+F11 (on the Chromebooks this is the key pointing left next to the ESC key).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Login and then run:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">rm -rf .cache/ .config/ .local/ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sync &amp;amp;&amp;amp; reboot
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>After reboot, the menu will have the correct entries. We&amp;rsquo;re still looking into why it occurs on only some of the images.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="download-kali-linux-20194">Download Kali Linux 2019.4&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So what are you waiting for? Start the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">download&lt;/a> now!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, just to mention we do also produce &lt;a href="https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/">weekly builds&lt;/a> that you can use as well. If it&amp;rsquo;s been some time since our last release and you want the latest packages you don&amp;rsquo;t have to go off our latest release and update. You can just use the weekly image instead, and have fewer updates to do. Just know these are automated builds that we don&amp;rsquo;t QA like we do our standard release images.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you already have an existing Kali installation, remember you can always do a quick update:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# cat &amp;lt;/etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib

root@kali:~#
root@kali:~# [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; reboot -f

&lt;p>If you want to switch to our new Xfce:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# apt -y install kali-desktop-xfce
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You should now be on Kali Linux 2019.4. We can do a quick check by doing:&lt;/p>

This release brings our &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/linux">kernel up to version 5.2.9&lt;/a>, and includes various new features across the board with NetHunter, ARM and packages (plus the normal bugs fixes and updates).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As promised in our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-roadmap-2019-2020/">roadmap blog post&lt;/a>, there are both user facing and backend updates.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cloudflare">CloudFlare&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/policy/kali-linux-open-source-policy/">Kali Linux is Open-source&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-open-source-your-upgrade-is-on-the-house/">Cloudflare hearts Open-source&lt;/a> - so it&amp;rsquo;s a perfect match! As a result, CloudFlare has graciously allowed us to use their content delivery network (CDN) to mirror our repository, allowing us to now distribute our content through them. A more technical breakdown can be found on &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-repositories-ftw/">their blog&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are currently running the CloudFlare services side by side with our standard and community mirrors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you notice the &lt;code>kali.download&lt;/code> domain appearing on screen when you run &lt;code>apt update&lt;/code>, this means you&amp;rsquo;re using CloudFlare&amp;rsquo;s services.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-status">Kali Status&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We now have a &lt;a href="https://status.kali.org/">status page - status.kali.org&lt;/a>. This provides an overview of all public facing domains and allows you to check if they are responding correctly. We have included all the sites we control, as well as the community mirrors for the repositories, allowing you to see everything you could possibly use (even if you are unaware)!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: Our load balancer on http.kali.org should automatically detect when a mirror is not responding and redirect you to one that is. As such, &lt;code>apt&lt;/code> should always work &lt;em>(even if slow at times)&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="metapackages">Metapackages&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We already announced the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/major-metapackage-makeover/">changes to metapackages in a previous blog post&lt;/a>, and the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/">Kali tool listing page&lt;/a> goes into more detail on it. However, to recap, the default toolset going forward has changed. To help with this transition, for this release only (Kali 2019.3), there is a one-off, extra image called &lt;code>kali-linux-large-2019.3-amd64.iso&lt;/code>, that contains all previous default tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Going forward, during our release cycle, we will be evaluating which tools belong to each group:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Kali-linux-default - tools we believe are essential to a penetration tester&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kali-linux-large - for penetration testers who have a wider set of non standard/common situations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kali-linux-everything - for those who want it all (and without Internet access during the assessment)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>With the switchover to &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux">GitLab&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-roadmap-2019-2020/">read more here&lt;/a>), we will soon begin accepting community package submissions. This means that anyone can directly submit improvements to us&amp;ndash;anything from minor fixes and patches to complete tool packages is encouraged. We&amp;rsquo;re currently working through the documentation on how to create a package, making it easier for folks to get started and help out. More details to come later this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also noticed some packages failed to build on certain ARM architectures, which has now been fixed (allowing for more tools to be used on different platforms!).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="helper-scripts">Helper Scripts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a wide range of tools in Kali. Some tools are designed to be used on Linux, some are designed for Windows &lt;em>(and we can still use them with WINE)&lt;/em>, and some are static resources. During our recent &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/major-metapackage-makeover/">metapackage refresh&lt;/a>, we took the time to create a few &amp;ldquo;helper scripts&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may have installed a package, gone ahead and typed in the package name to run it, and the response back was &lt;code>command not found&lt;/code>. Not any more!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We understood it may not have been obvious how to use them straight away. As a result, all of our static resources should now be easy to find. Just type in the package name (Such as &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/payloadsallthethings">PayloadsAllTheThings&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/seclists">SecLists&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/webshells">WebShells&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/wordlists">Wordlists&lt;/a> to a name a few), you&amp;rsquo;ll see a brief description, a directory listing, and then be moved to the folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# webshells

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>When it comes to Windows binaries (Such as &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/hyperion">hyperion&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/mimikatz">mimikatz&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/windows-privesc-check">windows-privesc-check&lt;/a>), depending on their functionality, it will now either start up WINE or, like above, hotlink you to the location.&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>On the subject of tool type, we have altered the location of packages related to Windows (which eagle eye readers may have spotted in the example above). These types of tools are now located in &lt;code>/usr/share/windows-resources/&lt;/code>. For example, our windows binaries used to be in &lt;code>/usr/share/windows-binaries/&lt;/code>, instead, they are in &lt;code>/usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/&lt;/code>.
We have done this to make it easier to discover what resources can be transferred over to a Windows platform and executed directly there. Using this new location as a root path (example: http &lt;code>python3 -m http.server&lt;/code>, or samba &lt;code>impacket-smbserver toolz .&lt;/code>), you can quickly share everything to the target/victim machine).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tool-updates--new-packages">Tool Updates &amp;amp; New Packages&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As always, we have our updates for all our tools, including (but not limited to):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/burpsuite">Burp Suite&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/hostapd-wpe">HostAPd-WPE&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/hyperion">Hyperion&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/kismet">Kismet&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/nmap">Nmap&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There is a new tool (and it is included by default), &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/amass">amass&lt;/a>, that has been well received in the bug bounty world.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="gnome-users">GNOME Users&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you use the default Kali image, it is &lt;em>(currently)&lt;/em> using GNOME for the desktop environment. If you used the command line for a period of time, chances are you noticed it was refreshing the repositories in the background. This has now been &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=5236">disabled&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="nethunter-updates">NetHunter Updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The NetHunter crew has been adding in features left, right, and center to their project. One thing to note is package management is done through the F-Droid compatible &lt;a href="https://store.nethunter.com/">NetHunter store&lt;/a>, so you can even choose to have a NetHunter device without any Google Play.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The proxmark3 client supports RDV4 out of the box and NetHunter now also works with Android&amp;rsquo;s new partition layouts (A/B partitions no longer have one boot partition and one recovery partition. They are all the same, but twice! A few paths have also changed, such as &lt;code>/system&lt;/code> now actually being under &lt;code>/system/system&lt;/code>), which allows it to be built for the latest generation of devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus, there are new apps in the NetHunter app store, thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mayank_metha">@mayank_metha&lt;/a> for Rucky and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/graphs/contributors">Termux team&lt;/a> for Termux.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are 4 additional images for you to try NetHunter on (some may look familiar, as they are back due to community demand):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>LG V20 International Edition&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nexus 5X&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nexus 10&lt;/li>
&lt;li>OnePlus 7 (Our new flagship device!)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-3-release/images/nethunter-release-2019.3-02.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this announcement, the &lt;strong>OnePlus 7&lt;/strong> is now the phone we recommend for Kali NetHunter. It is the latest and greatest flagship device for half the price of other devices. The specifications are as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Snapdragon 855&lt;/li>
&lt;li>8GB RAM&lt;/li>
&lt;li>256GB storage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Still cheaper than Google pixel 3a (mid-range phone!) ;)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And here is a sneaky peak at the new boot animation, across all devices:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2019-3-release/images/nethunter-release-2019.3-01.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="arm-update">ARM Update&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For ARM devices this release, we have added support for the &lt;a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinebook/">PINEBOOK&lt;/a> as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.gateworks.com/imx6-single-board-computer-gateworks-ventana-family">Gateworks Ventana&lt;/a> machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The RaspberryPi kernel has been bumped to version 4.19.66, which includes support for all of the RAM on 64-bit versions of the RaspberryPi 4. The RaspberryPi Zero W has seen improvements as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bluetooth firmware that was accidentally dropped has been added back in, and the &lt;code>rc.local&lt;/code> file has been fixed to properly stop &lt;code>dmesg&lt;/code> spam from showing up on the first console.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of the RaspberryPi images have had their &lt;code>/boot&lt;/code> partition increased, which is required due to the size of the new kernel packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ODROID-C2 has been bumped to the 3.16.72 for its kernel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All images now run &lt;code>dpkg-reconfigure xfonts-base&lt;/code> on their first boot - this will cause a bit of a slow down for the first boot, but the result is that if you use VNC to any of them, they will no longer show a blank screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-on-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/">WSL&lt;/a> front, we have added WSL ARM64 support, which you can find in the &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/kali-linux/9pkr34tncv07?rtc=1&amp;amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Windows store&lt;/a> today.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="official-kali-linux-lxd-container-image-released">Official Kali Linux LXD Container Image Released&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>LXD is a next generation system container manager. It offers a user experience similar to virtual machines but using Linux containers instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is image based with pre-made images available for a wide number of Linux distributions and we are excited to announce that Kali Linux is now one of them. We are working on the documentation but would like to share the excellent article from &lt;a href="https://blog.simos.info/using-the-lxd-kali-container-image/">Simos Xenitellis&lt;/a> in which he details how to install and run Kismet in a LXD Kali container.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setup-notes">Setup Notes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A couple of notes when installing Kali. If you choose to install Kali in a VM (rather than &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/">downloading our pre-made image&lt;/a>), during the setup process, it should now detect if its running in &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-vmware-guest-tools/">VMware&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-virtualbox-guest-additions/">VirtualBox&lt;/a> and install the necessary packages to give you the best experience possible. However, if you have upgraded Kali rather than doing a fresh install, and never got around to installing these packages, the process has been automated by just running &lt;code>kali-setup&lt;/code>. This program will have more functionally at a later date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you use Kali in a VirtualBox, please ensure you allocate 32 MB or more video memory to the VM, otherwise you may now run into some &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; issues where the screen is frozen after login through the graphical greeter, as if the computer had crashed, except that it&amp;rsquo;s working (you could confirm it by switching to another virtual terminal). If you are affected by this &lt;a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=934483">problem&lt;/a>, you might see the following message from the kernel: &lt;code>[drm] Error -12 pinnning new fb, out of video mem?&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are using Kali Linux via &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/announcing-kali-for-vagrant/">Vagrant&lt;/a>, the path has now changed. It can now be found here: &lt;a href="https://app.vagrantup.com/kalilinux">kalilinux/rolling&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="download-kali-linux-20193">Download Kali Linux 2019.3&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you would like to check out the latest Kali release, you can find the download links for ISOs and Torrents on the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali Downloads page&lt;/a> along with links to the &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/">Offensive Security virtual machine and ARM images&lt;/a>, which have also been updated to 2019.3. If you already have a Kali installation you&amp;rsquo;re happy with, you can easily upgrade in place as follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt -y full-upgrade
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="ensuring-your-installation-is-updated">Ensuring your Installation is Updated&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To double check your version, first make sure your Kali package repositories are correct:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# cat &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF&amp;gt;/etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib
EOF
root@kali:~#
root@kali:~# apt update
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Afterwards run &lt;code>apt -y full-upgrade&lt;/code>, you may require a &lt;code>reboot&lt;/code> (if the kernel got upgraded):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# apt -y full-upgrade

These alterations are designed to optimize Kali, reduce ISO size, and better organize metapackages as we continue to grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before we get into what&amp;rsquo;s new, let&amp;rsquo;s briefly recap what a metapackage is. A metapackage is a package that does not contain any tools itself, but rather is a dependency list of normal packages (or other metapackages). This allows us to group related tools together. For instance, if you want to be able to access every wireless tool, simply install the &lt;code>kali-tools-wireless&lt;/code> metapackage. This will obtain all wireless tools in one download. As always, you can access the full list of metapackages available in Kali on &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/">kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/&lt;/a>. If you prefer to use the command line, the following command will list out the packages that will be installed via a specific metapackage:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# apt update

Depends: rfcat
Depends: rfkill
rfkill:i386
Depends: sakis3g
Depends: spectools
Depends: wireshark
root@kali:~#
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We took the time to create new metapackages and rename existing ones, and we did the same with the tools listed inside of them. As a result of these changes, we&amp;rsquo;ve implemented a new naming convention for simplicity and improved granular control. At the end of the post there is a table displaying the relationships between previous and new names moving forward, along with a description of the metapackage purpose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have made it this far, you are likely wondering &amp;ldquo;how does this affect me&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you are using a version of Kali older than 2019.3, if and when you upgrade, you will still have the same set of tools (just newer)!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>However, if you do a fresh install of Kali with a version higher than either &lt;a href="https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/">weekly W34&lt;/a> or 2019.3 ISO, you will notice some of the &lt;strong>tools that get installed by DEFAULT have changed&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(we have put Kali on a diet!)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Previously, &lt;code>kali-linux-full&lt;/code> was the default metapackage, which has been renamed to &lt;code>kali-linux-large&lt;/code> with a redirect put in place. We have introduced a new default metapackage called &lt;code>kali-linux-default&lt;/code>, which serves as a slimmed-down version of the tools from &lt;code>kali-linux-large&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Depending on how you use Kali will determine which metapackage would suit you best. This is the power of metapackages. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you want a core set of tools, stick with &lt;code>kali-linux-default&lt;/code> &lt;em>(designed for assessments that are straightforward )&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you want a more general and wider range of tools, select &lt;code>kali-linux-large&lt;/code> &lt;em>(useful if Internet access is permitted but slow)&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you want to be prepared for anything, go with &lt;code>kali-linux-everything&lt;/code> &lt;em>(great if you are going to be doing air-gap/offline work)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Note: You can install multiple metapackages at once and are not limited to just one, so mix and match!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each of these metapackages depends on the one above. That means, when we add a new essential tool to &lt;code>kali-linux-default&lt;/code>, it is automatically part of &lt;code>kali-linux-large&lt;/code> and thus &lt;code>kali-linux-everything&lt;/code>. Otherwise, when we add a new tool that may not be useful to everyone, it will be placed into either &lt;code>kali-linux-large&lt;/code> or &lt;code>kali-linux-everything&lt;/code> - depending on our tool policy. More information about the new tool policy will be made public towards the end of the year. Stay tuned for some very exciting news!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How Kali is being used today has changed since when Kali (and even &lt;a href="https://www.backtrack-linux.org/">BackTrack&lt;/a>) was first born. Not everyone needs all the tools at once - but they are still available when required. We have opted for a new default set of tools to match the majority of today&amp;rsquo;s current network environments, by removing edge cases and legacy tools which are rarely used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upon doing a system upgrade (&lt;code>apt -y full-upgrade&lt;/code>) on a version of Kali older than 2019.3, you will see the old metapackage name being removed. This is safe.
If you have tried to remove a tool before, you may have run into this (when the tool is part of a metapackage). This is also safe to remove, as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t remove any other tools. It simply means that when a new tool is added into that metapackage, you won&amp;rsquo;t receive it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are running 2019.3 and want the old default set of tools, you can do either &lt;code>apt -y install &amp;lt;tool&amp;gt;&lt;/code> for a one-off package installation or &lt;code>apt -y install kali-linux-large&lt;/code> to get the old tool set back. For the 2019.3 release, we will be doing a one-off extra image, which is based on &lt;code>kali-linux-large&lt;/code> to help with the transition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below are the tables with a complete breakdown of previous metapackages names, along with their new respective names:&lt;/p>

Now supporting over 50 devices and running on Android devices from KitKat (v4.4) to Pie (v9.0), its amazing the extra capabilities that have been introduced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to stop there. After a ton of work, we are really excited to introduce the &lt;a href="https://store.nethunter.com/">Kali NetHunter App Store&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-new-android-store-dedicated-to-free-security-apps">The New Android Store Dedicated to Free Security Apps&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Originally meant to conveniently manage the packages on NetHunter devices, we soon realized that the NetHunter store should also be available for non-NetHunter devices. So here it is, available to everyone that would like the best of both worlds:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ease of use and convenience of the Google Play Store&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Freedom, anonymity and privacy of sideloaded applications&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-nethunter-app-store/images/nethunter-store-02.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Kali NetHunter App Store is a one stop shop for security relevant Android applications.
It is the ultimate alternative to the Google Play store for any Android device, whether rooted or not, NetHunter or stock. If you are after any security application for your Android device, the NetHunter Store will be the place to get it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The NetHunter store is powered by a slightly modified version of &lt;a href="https://f-droid.org/en/">F-Droid&lt;/a>, thanks to the hard work of the F-Droid community, in particular &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/serwylo">Peter Serwylo&lt;/a> whose help was invaluable.
Whilst F-Droid installs its clients with telemetry disabled and asks for consent before submitting crash reports, we went a step further and removed the entire code - just to make sure that our privacy cannot be compromised by accident.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also widened the inclusion policy to allow proprietary applications into the store.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="call-for-applications">Call for Applications&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you are an application developer and you would like your application to be included in the NetHunter App Store, please let us know via a &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/store/rfp/-/issues">Request for packaging&lt;/a> or in the &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/forumdisplay.php?35-App-Store">forums&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please note: We accept binary APK files as well as links to git repositories that we use to build the applications ourselves.
Third party APK files are preferably signed by the original author whereas apps built by us from source are built using GitLab CI and are signed by us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you would like us to include an application that you are not the author of, please let us know and we&amp;rsquo;ll try to get the authors consent to publish it in our store.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We encourage all Android users to head over to the &lt;a href="https://store.nethunter.com/">NetHunter App Store (https://store.nethunter.com/)&lt;/a>, download the Store app, have a go and join us in the &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/forumdisplay.php?35-App-Store">forums&lt;/a> to give us feedback and get involved.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>NetHunter is a community project. It is driven by the community for the community and it is a whole lot of fun. The project is centered around bringing Kali Linux to Android devices and to add a user experience that makes Android a valid alternative for certain areas of penetration testing and hacking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Working on the NetHunter project, including the NetHunter Store, provides exposure to a wide variety of technologies, such as:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Android app development&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rooting Android &amp;amp; creating custom recovery installers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kernel &amp;amp; kernel drivers, in particular WiFi&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kali Linux&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All tools that ship with Kali Linux&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Web technologies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Android package management&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;hellip;and many more.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>But most importantly:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Putting it all together and hack Radio frequency (RF), Wi-Fi, Apps and everything else you can get your hands on!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you are good at any of the above, or you would like to become good at any of them, please join us in the &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/forumdisplay.php?35-App-Store">forums&lt;/a> or on &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/community/kali-linux-irc-channel/">IRC&lt;/a> OFTC, #NetHunter](&lt;a href="https://webchat.oftc.net/?randomnick=1&amp;amp;channels=nethunter)">https://webchat.oftc.net/?randomnick=1&amp;amp;channels=nethunter)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi 4 and Kali</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/raspberry-pi-4-and-kali/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/raspberry-pi-4-and-kali/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/raspberry-pi-4-and-kali/images/kali-raspberry-pi-4.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>We love the Raspberry Pi, and judging by the response we got to a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kalilinux/status/1144895236025585665">late night tweet&lt;/a> we sent out last weekend a lot of you love the Pi too!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of that, when the &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-4-on-sale-now-from-35/">Pi 4 dropped&lt;/a> we wanted to get Kali supported on it right away.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-new-on-the-raspberry-pi-4">What&amp;rsquo;s new on the Raspberry Pi 4?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Raspberry Pi 4 is actually a pretty amazing little machine. The Pi has always been known for its low cost and easy accessibility, but with the 4 we can actually throw real performance onto that list as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the Raspberry Pi 4 we have a completely upgraded, re-engineered device that includes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A more powerful CPU&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Options for 1, 2, or 4 GB of RAM&lt;/li>
&lt;li>USB-C power supply&lt;/li>
&lt;li>USB 2 &amp;amp; USB 3&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gigabit ethernet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 micro HDMI ports&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And now you can add to that list full Kali Linux support complete with on-board wifi monitor mode &amp;amp; frame injection support!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/raspberry-pi-4-and-kali/images/kali-pi4.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To say we are excited about this is an understatement, and we hope many of you are just as excited!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="try-it-out">Try it out!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can download Kali Linux for the Raspberry Pi 4 on the &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/">Kali ARM download page&lt;/a>. Currently we only have 32Bit support for it, but expect 64Bit in the near future. The installation instructions are not any different than the Pi2, so feel free to &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/raspberry-pi-2/">follow our docs&lt;/a> on getting it setup if you don&amp;rsquo;t know how.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have it running feel free to let us know how its working for you &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/forumdisplay.php?7-Kali-Linux-ARM-Architecture">on our forums&lt;/a>. Stay tuned for more Pi updates as we work with the 4 and find new and interesting things to do with it!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux in the DigitalOcean Cloud</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-in-the-digitalocean-cloud/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-in-the-digitalocean-cloud/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-in-the-digitalocean-cloud/images/kali-digital-ocean.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean&lt;/a> is a cloud provider similar to AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and many others. They offer instances, called &amp;ldquo;droplets&amp;rdquo;, with different Linux distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, FreeBSD, etc. Similar to AWS, DigitalOcean has datacenters around the world and sometimes multiple datacenters in each country.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, one feature in particular sets them apart them from their competitors. A little while ago, they added support for &lt;a href="https://blog.digitalocean.com/custom-images/">custom images&lt;/a>, which allows users to import virtual machine disks and use them as droplets. This is perfect for us as we can use our own version of Kali Linux in their cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While it might be possible to load the &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/">official Kali Linux virtual images&lt;/a>, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be very efficient. Instead, we&amp;rsquo;ll build a lightweight Kali installation with the bare minimum to get it working.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="generate-an-iso">Generate an ISO&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>By default, the Kali Linux ISOs have a GUI installed, and while we could use it, we want to minimize the amount of data we have to upload to DigitalOcean for reasons we will talk about later. Having a GUI running on a headless system is also a waste of resources so while we could uninstall it or disable it, we&amp;rsquo;ll &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/live-build-a-custom-kali-iso/">just generate a custom Kali ISO&lt;/a> without a GUI or any other tools installed. Building the ISO will require around 5 GB of hard drive space so make sure you have enough if you&amp;rsquo;re following along.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, we&amp;rsquo;ll make sure the system is up to date:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt update
apt -y full-upgrade
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>In case a new kernel was installed, let&amp;rsquo;s reboot the system before continuing and then proceed to start the build.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt -y install git live-build cdebootstrap devscripts
git clone https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/live-build-config.git
cd live-build-config
./build.sh --variant minimal --verbose
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>It will take a while to build the ISO as it needs to download a lot of packages and assemble them. In the meantime, enjoy a nice cup of joe. Or tea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &amp;lsquo;&amp;ndash;verbose&amp;rsquo; option will display the build log on the screen. It can however be removed, and instead progress can be followed in the &lt;strong>&lt;em>build.log&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> file:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">tail -f build.log
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Once our prompt returns on the terminal where &amp;lsquo;build.sh&amp;rsquo; was launched, the ISO is ready and can be found in the &lt;strong>&lt;em>images/&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="create-the-virtual-machine">Create the Virtual Machine&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With our ISO built, we can now begin to build our virtual machine. Create a new virtual machine setting the OS to the latest Debian 64 bit and allocating a 20 GB hard disk. If needed, detailed set-up is explained on the &lt;a href="https://kali.training/topic/booting-kali-in-live-mode/">Kali Training website&lt;/a>. It is important to store the virtual disk as a single file that is dynamically allocated. The rest like the amount of CPU and RAM won&amp;rsquo;t matter because only the disk file will be uploaded to DigitalOcean.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Disk size matters as billing is based on disk size for custom images. It will also impact the choice of instance we can create. Let&amp;rsquo;s say a 40 GB hard disk is created, it will fail creating an instance at the $5/month level because its maximum hard disk size is 25 GB. In that case we would be forced to use the $10/month option for instances with 50 GB disks. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, even though the disk is 20 GB, it will get expanded depending on the droplet plan chosen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the installation, select manual partitioning and set it up as shown below, with all files in one partition and no swap file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-in-the-digitalocean-cloud/images/Picture1-1.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="update-the-system">Update the System&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When installation is complete and after rebooting, we login at the console and update the system:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt update
apt -y full-upgrade
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t see it going over a mirror during &amp;lsquo;apt update&amp;rsquo;, you may have accidentally forgotten to add a network mirror during the installation. Follow the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/kali-linux-sources-list-repositories/">instructions on the Kali-Docs site&lt;/a> to fix it and run both of the commands again.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="install-required-packages">Install Required Packages&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In order for DigitalOcean to configure the system for us, we need to install the &lt;strong>&lt;em>cloud-init&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> package:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt -y install cloud-init
echo 'datasource_list: [ ConfigDrive, DigitalOcean, NoCloud, None ]' &amp;gt; /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99_digitalocean.cfg
systemctl enable cloud-init
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="update-grub">Update GRUB&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When booting, the disk is attached and mapped as sda1. However, with the droplets, it is seen as vda1. To remedy this, we need to change all instances of sda1 to vda1 in &lt;strong>&lt;em>/boot/grub/grub.cfg&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">sed -i 's/sda1/vda1/g' /boot/grub/grub.cfg
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With the configuration file updated, we can run &amp;lsquo;update-grub&amp;rsquo; to update the system:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">update-grub
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="prepare-for-ssh">Prepare for SSH&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since we will need to use SSH to connect to the system on DigitalOcean, the &lt;strong>&lt;em>openssh-server&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> package needs to be installed (and enabled) as well:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt -y install openssh-server
systemctl enable ssh.service
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>When creating a standard droplet, you can choose to use SSH keys or not. However, when using custom images, this isn&amp;rsquo;t an option and using SSH keys is mandatory. For this reason, DigitalOcean requires us to remove the root password:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">passwd -d root
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We also need to create a &lt;strong>&lt;em>/root/.ssh&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> folder:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">mkdir /root/.ssh
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="cleanup">Cleanup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Before we finish with our virtual machine, we run a few commands to clean things up:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt autoremove
apt autoclean
rm -rf /var/log/*
history -c
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>At this point, our virtual machine is ready so we run &amp;lsquo;poweroff&amp;rsquo; to shutdown the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">poweroff
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="uploading">Uploading&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the virtual machine folder, locate the &lt;strong>&lt;em>.vmdk&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> file, then compress it using bzip2, gzip, or zip in preparation for uploading to DigitalOcean.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">bzip2 kali.vmdk
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Login to your DigitalOcean account. In the &amp;ldquo;Manage&amp;rdquo; section on the left, click on &amp;ldquo;Images&amp;rdquo;, then select the &amp;ldquo;Custom Images&amp;rdquo; tab.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-in-the-digitalocean-cloud/images/Picture2.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From there, we upload the compressed disk image. We&amp;rsquo;ll name it Kali, mark it as Debian, and select the region and datacenter to upload it to. Note that once uploaded to a location, droplets can only be started at that location, which is a current limitation for custom images. Another thing to remember at this stage is that uploaded images consume disk space and DigitalOcean will bill based on disk usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-in-the-digitalocean-cloud/images/Picture3-1.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="starting-a-droplet">Starting a Droplet&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once done, the &amp;ldquo;Uploaded&amp;rdquo; column will indicate how long ago it was uploaded. Now we will click on the &amp;ldquo;More&amp;rdquo; option of the image and select &amp;ldquo;Start a droplet&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-in-the-digitalocean-cloud/images/Picture4.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will be taken to the droplet settings where you can select the droplet plan, the SSH key, and the project to start it in. Since this is a custom image, it is required you use a SSH key. You can either select an existing one or upload a new one by clicking on &amp;ldquo;New SSH key&amp;rdquo;, which will open the following screen where you can paste the public key and name it:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-in-the-digitalocean-cloud/images/Picture5-1.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once done, click &amp;ldquo;Create&amp;rdquo; as shown below. It will then take you back to the dashboard (Manage &amp;gt; Droplets) where all your droplets are listed. Because we are using a SSH key, DigitalOcean will not send an email with credentials for the droplet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-in-the-digitalocean-cloud/images/Picture5b.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within a few seconds, and after the IP is displayed, our droplet will be ready. In order to connect, we will need to use the private SSH key we created (called MY_KEY in this example):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">user@computer:~$ ssh -i MY_KEY root@192.168.1.1

Normally, we only really announce things when they are ready to go public, but a number of these changes are going to impact users pretty extensively so we wanted to share them early.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you read through this post, what you will see is that we are really trying to balance our efforts between changes that are user facing and those that are applicable to the backend. The backend changes don&amp;rsquo;t seem as exciting at first, but the fact is that the easier it is for us to work on Kali, the easier it is for us to get to user facing features. Plus, some of these changes are focused on tweaking the development process to make it easier for others to get involved in the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are not ready to announce dates on any of these changes just yet. When they are ready, they will drop.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="gitlab---the-new-home-for-kali-packages">GitLab - The New Home for Kali Packages&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One of the biggest changes, which you may have already noticed, is our move of the Official Kali git repository to &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux">GitLab&lt;/a>. With this change, it&amp;rsquo;s easier than ever for the community to submit improvements to Kali packages and for us to apply them! We expect to make an heavy use of the GitLab Continous Integration features to streamline our work on packages and to provide automated feedback to all the contributors submitting merge requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Documentation is coming soon on how to contribute packages. Expect a full guide to be published in &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/">our docs&lt;/a> later.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="runtime-tests---finding-bugs-before-users">Runtime Tests - Finding Bugs Before Users&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Speaking of packages, the detection of bugs and problems with the packages is always something to improve. Until now, we have relied on manual testing on our part and &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">user-provided bug reports&lt;/a>. This works ok, as popular packages would never stay broken for long but some edge packages could break for months at a time before anyone would notice and actually report it to us. (Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, most of the time when you find something broken in Kali, you don&amp;rsquo;t create a bug report do you?)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To improve this situation, we have recently deployed &lt;a href="https://salsa.debian.org/ci-team/debci">debci&lt;/a> on &lt;a href="https://autopkgtest.kali.org/">autopkgtest.kali.org&lt;/a>. This allows us to have our own continuous integration system, allowing for automated testing of Kali packages on a regular basis. We have integrated the result of those tests in the &lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/teams/kali-developers/">Kali Package Tracker&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this infrastructure to be as useful as it can be, we will need to have &lt;a href="https://salsa.debian.org/ci-team/autopkgtest/raw/master/doc/README.package-tests.rst">runtime tests&lt;/a> on all our packages, which is still a long way off. Hopefully, this will be a place where we &lt;strong>get community help to speed up the process&lt;/strong>, so feel free to submit &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages">merge requests&lt;/a> adding tests!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="metapackages---what-is-installed-by-default">Metapackages - What is Installed by Default&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One of the biggest challenges with running a project like Kali Linux is balance. We now have so many users that there&amp;rsquo;s no longer &amp;ldquo;one right size&amp;rdquo;. Traditionally, what people have asked for is &amp;ldquo;all the tools, all the time&amp;rdquo;. But as time has gone by, this has led to one of the largest (pun fully intended) issues with Kali: Bloat. Too many packages making too big of a distribution, large ISO sizes, etc. etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To address this, we are giving our metapackages a refresh. This change includes the default Kali metapackage, &amp;ldquo;kali-linux-full&amp;rdquo;, the metapackage that controls what packages are installed on Kali by default. Needless to say, this is a big user-facing change that will impact everyone. Tools that we decide to drop are most often older tools that don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of modern utility, have not been updated in years, or have been supplanted by newer better tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What this means is that by default, some of the tools you may have relied upon may no longer be included by default. These tools will still exist in the repo, so you can install them manually or use a metapackage that contains them. You can see full documentation of the metapackages and what they contain at &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/">kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before these changes go live, we will do another blog post detailing them. Expect that these metapackages will be in flux for a bit as we continue to optimize.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="default-shell---your-primary-kali-interface">Default Shell - Your Primary Kali Interface&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The shell in Kali is likely the most used utility in the entire distribution for the majority of users. This creates a bit of a schizophrenic challenge in that it&amp;rsquo;s used so much we want to improve it, but at the same time we have to make sure it does not break.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To address this, we will be adding default installations of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell">ZSH&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_interactive_shell">FISH&lt;/a> to Kali. Each of these shells are optimized for penetration testers, which is sort of fun. Most of the time when you look at shell optimization, all the text is focused on developers, which is not where Kali sits. Our goal here is to have the best, most optimized, shell environment for penetration testers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the same time, good old Bash won&amp;rsquo;t go away and we are going to leave it as the default for now. Those of you that want to be adventurous and try the new shells will find easy ways to switch. Those of you that just want to stick with Bash will still be able to. Expect in-shell instructions (and a blog post) when this change is rolled out.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="documentation---read-the-fine-manual">Documentation - Read The Fine Manual&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Expect some changes to &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/">&lt;strong>kali.org/docs/&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/">&lt;strong>kali.org/tools/&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, along with an integration of the Kali manual into git via markdown. This will allow for user submitted documentation to help us keep instructions up to date and accurate. This is another great way for you to contribute to the Kali Linux project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="nethunter---new-blood">NetHunter - New Blood&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As you may have noticed on Twitter and git commits, we have got another developer on board, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Re4sonKernel">Re4son&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, and he has put the &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-nethunter-download/">NetHunter&lt;/a> project into overdrive. He is working on supporting new hardware, working with the latest version of Android, and various bug fixes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is also &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Project Redback&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;, but that is all we are going to say about that for the time being&amp;hellip;more about this in a blog post very soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-else-can-we-expect">What Else can we Expect?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is just the portion of the roadmap that makes sense to talk about now. There is a lot more in development that we are just not ready to talk about yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also would like to welcome &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/g0tmi1k">g0tmi1k&lt;/a> who has switched over from &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/">Offensive Security&lt;/a> as a full time core &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/about-us/">Kali developer&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are at a really exciting stage of the Kali development process, where a lot of the behind the scenes items we have been working on are getting ready to go public. Expect a fair amount of improvements in Kali Linux over the next half of the year. If you want to discuss this post with us or have ideas on things that we might consider, please get in touch via &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php?44470-Kali-Linux-Roadmap-(2019-2020)&amp;amp;p=86334#post86334">the forum&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>WSL2 and Kali</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/wsl2-and-kali/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/wsl2-and-kali/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/wsl2-and-kali/images/wsl2-and-kali.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>Kali Linux has had support for WSL for &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-on-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/">some time&lt;/a>, but its usefulness has been somewhat limited. This was mostly due to restrictions placed on some system calls , most importantly those revolving &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/1349">around networking&lt;/a>. Furthermore, additional issues with speed, specifically I/O, were also problematic. Because of this, Kali WSL has mostly been relegated to reporting functions after an assessment is completed. A cool technology, and certainly an amazing engineering feat, but as is, it just was not that useful in the field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/announcing-wsl-2/">WSL 2 was announced&lt;/a> however, we were excited about what this could mean for actually making Kali WSL more useful in. As such, when we saw that WSL 2 was available in the &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl-2-is-now-available-in-windows-insiders/">Windows Insiders program&lt;/a> we wanted to jump right on it and see what improvements were made.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wsl2-conversion">WSL2 Conversion&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>After you have the new Windows Insider build installed, converting Kali WSL 1 to 2 is very easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/wsl2-and-kali/images/conversion-cropped.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was a great surprise for us, as it also means we don&amp;rsquo;t have to do anything on our end to support WSL2. Kali&amp;rsquo;s current WSL distribution will work just fine, and you can convert your existing installation easily. According to &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-index">the docs&lt;/a> you can also set WSL2 as your default if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a Kali installed yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, this was a great surprise, and means Kali is ready for WSL 2 today.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="kali-wsl-2-usage">Kali WSL 2 Usage&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Ok, so WSL 2 works with Kali, but is it useful? We are just starting to play with WSL 2, so it&amp;rsquo;s really too early to say. However there are a few quick observations we have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basic usage, such as updating Kali and installing packages, appears to work just fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/wsl2-and-kali/images/kali-update-cropped.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/wsl2-and-kali/images/nmap1.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, simply installing something is not that interesting, The question is: does it work? One specific tool we wanted to immediately check was Nmap, which has always been a WSL pain point. As you can see from the screenshot, a basic Nmap scan works right out of the box! Thats great news and is very promising for WSL 2 as it continues development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/wsl2-and-kali/images/nmap-run.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That should not be a great surprise however, as WSL 2 at its core is really a low overhead and optimized VM. This has brought about some changes for those of us who have been using WSL for a while. These changes fall mostly along the lines of process spaces, networking, and filesystem interaction. This brings up some items we will have to watch as WSL continues to mature.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="all-networking-appears-to-be-nated-in-the-current-release">All networking appears to be NATed in the current release.&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Microsoft states:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the initial builds of the WSL 2 preview, you will need to access any Linux server from Windows using the IP address of your Linux distro, and any Windows server from Linux using the IP address of your host machine. This is something that is temporary, and very high on our priority list to fix.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So, no bridged mode. Anyone who uses Kali in a VM knows that for an actual assessment work it&amp;rsquo;s always better to run Kali in bridged mode, not NAT. With the current release, reverse shells are really not going to be an easy option without playing around with port forwarding on the Windows side. Additionally, we don&amp;rsquo;t yet know the strength of the NAT engine. While scans ran through WSL2 are now possible, their results will remain questionable until we find how much the NAT engine impacts them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="as-it-is-in-a-vm-the-process-space-is-separate">As it is in a VM, the process space is separate.&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This is interesting, as it might actually open up Kali WSL 2 to be a useful endpoint protection bypass. If you get code execution on a Windows 10 system that supports WSL 2, could you install a Kali instance and pivot from there instead of the base operating system? This remains to be seen as this is still in development and Microsoft seems to want to unify the Linux and Windows experience as much as possible. The end point protection programs might become &amp;ldquo;WSL Aware&amp;rdquo;, which makes this is an interesting item to watch.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="wsl-2s-filesystem-is-now-in-a-virtual-disk">WSL 2&amp;rsquo;s filesystem is now in a virtual disk.&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Similar to traditional VMs, there is now a virtual disk that holds the WSL 2 instance. In the past, one of the WSL issues that would come up is that many Kali tools would trigger anti-virus protections. To keep Kali WSL useful you would have to make exclusions for the location in which the Kali files were saved on the Windows filesystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that it&amp;rsquo;s in a virtual disk, much like the process space isolation, it will remain to be seen how AV might deal with it. Currently, it appears that AV ignores this virtual disk and its contents but as WSL reaches general availability it is possible AV products will become WSL 2 aware. Again, something we will need to watch.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="overall">Overall&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As it stands, WSL 2 is an exciting technology and most definitely worth paying attention to. This is the first public beta and a lot will change over time. As such, we will track its development and see what we can do to make WSL 2 more useful for our purposes. As it stands however, it already seems more useful than what we have experienced with WSL 1 for actual production use.

&lt;h3 id="kali-nethunter-20192-release">Kali NetHunter 2019.2 Release&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Thanks to the tireless contributions from the vibrant NetHunter community led by re4son, binkybear, fattire, jmingov, jcadduono, kimocoder, and PaulWebSec, NetHunter now supports over 50 devices running all the latest Android versions, from KitKat through to Pie. To celebrate this milestone, we have released &lt;strong>13&lt;/strong> new NetHunter images for the latest Android versions of our favourite devices, including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Nexus 6 running Pie&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nexus 6P, Oreo&lt;/li>
&lt;li>OnePlus2, Pie&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Galaxy Tab S4 LTE &amp;amp; WiFi, Oreo&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These and many more can be downloaded from our &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-nethunter-download/">NetHunter&lt;/a> page. If you cannot find an image for your favourite device and you are interested in porting NetHunter, we would love for you to join our community and give it a crack. More information can be found at our new home on &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter/">kali-docs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tool-upgrades">Tool Upgrades&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>The 2019.1 Kali release for ARM includes the return of Banana Pi and Banana Pro, both of which are on the 4.19 kernel. Veyron has been moved to a 4.19 kernel and the Raspberry Pi images have been simplified so it is easier to figure out which one to use. There are no longer separate Raspberry Pi images for users with TFT LCDs because we now include re4son&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong>kalipi-tft-config&lt;/strong> script on all of them, so if you want to set up a board with a TFT, run &amp;lsquo;kalipi-tft-config&amp;rsquo; and follow the prompts.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://planetcom.squarespace.com/device/">Gemini PDA&lt;/a> from Planet Computers is an ultra-thin, clamshell mobile device with a tactile keyboard. Sporting a 5.99&amp;quot; screen, QWERTY keyboard, 4G &amp;amp; Wi-Fi, deca-core CPU, and an Open-source bootloader that supports multi-boot, it caught our attention straight away when it popped up on Indiegogo. It is a great little pocket rocket and having a landscape orientation and hardware keyboard, is well suited for a native Kali installation with a full &lt;a href="https://lxqt.org/">LXQT&lt;/a> desktop environment.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>LXQT with SDDM is lightweight, provides great scaling for tiny screens, has good touch support, and a slick modern layout. Whilst using the tiny touchscreen looks a bit intimidating initially, it is surprisingly finger friendly. We don&amp;rsquo;t bother using a mouse anymore with this device.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="linux--android-integration">Linux / Android integration&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Being basically a pimped up cell phone requires a convergence of Linux (glibc) and Android (bionic) to drive the hardware not yet natively supported by GNU/Linux. We are using components from the &lt;a href="https://halium.org/">Halium project&lt;/a> to achieve that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bringing GNU/Linux to the Gemini PDA, or any other mobile platform, is in the very early stages and some of it still needs a bit of work, such as data and voice support, GPS, power management, etc. There is currently one known issue with the Gemini having occasional issues when shutting down. The community is currently working on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a very stable experience thanks to the hard work of the &lt;a href="https://sailfishos.org/">Sailfish&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/gemian/gemini-keyboard-apps/wiki">Gemian&lt;/a> communities, in particular TheKit and adam_b, who brought Gemian to the Gemini PDA and helped a lot with this project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="installation">Installation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We have published a &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/gemini-pda/">Gemini installation guide&lt;/a> on our documentation site to get you up and running quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="support">Support&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Linux on the Gemini PDA is very experimental with limited manufacturer support and some hardware is not natively supported by Linux, requiring some community hacks. Offensive Security does not provide technical support for the Gemini. Support for Kali on the Gemini can be obtained via various methods listed on the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/community/">Kali Linux Community&lt;/a> page.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Gemini PDA is a nifty little powerhouse that combines the charm and handling of the good old Psion series with the power of a modern ARM64, making it the ideal mobile platform for a desktop version of Kali Linux with touch support.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the community demand for Kali Linux on the Gemini and considering that the manufacturer has just launched a new crowd funding campaign for another device, having a Kali platform for this particular hardware segment is setting us up for exciting times ahead.&lt;/p>

Starting now, you can find an officially maintained Kali Linux image in the &lt;a href="https://app.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant Cloud&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-vagrant">What is Vagrant?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>From Vagrant&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">website&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Put simply, with a single configuration file, you can download a base &amp;ldquo;box&amp;rdquo; and apply additional configurations like adding an additional network interface, setting the number of CPU cores and memory, or running a script on first boot. Even more importantly, all of this is contained in a configuration file, which is very easy to share compared to a virtual machine that spans many gigabytes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To get started, first install &lt;a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox&lt;/a>. Then create an empty directory and from there run the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">$ vagrant init kalilinux/rolling
A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This will create a file named &lt;strong>&lt;em>Vagrantfile&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>, which contains all the configuration options for the virtual machine. Every &amp;lsquo;vagrant&amp;rsquo; command must be run from the directory containing that file. By default, it contains only the box name as well as many commented common options. We&amp;rsquo;ll review some of those later, but here is an excerpt.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">$ cat Vagrantfile
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :
# All Vagrant configuration is done below. The &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; in Vagrant.configure
# configures the configuration version (we support older styles for
# backwards compatibility). Please don't change it unless you know what
# you're doing.
Vagrant.configure(&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;) do |config|
# The most common configuration options are documented and commented below.
# For a complete reference, please see the online documentation at
# https://docs.vagrantup.com.
# Every Vagrant development environment requires a box. You can search for
# boxes at https://vagrantcloud.com/search.
config.vm.box = &amp;quot;kalilinux/rolling&amp;quot;
...
# Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
# within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
# accessing &amp;quot;localhost:8080&amp;quot; will access port 80 on the guest machine.
# NOTE: This will enable public access to the opened port
# config.vm.network &amp;quot;forwarded_port&amp;quot;, guest: 80, host: 8080
...
end
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Next, make sure you have enough disk space. The vagrant &amp;ldquo;box&amp;rdquo; (you can think of it as a template) uses around 4GB, and the spun up VM will take around 10GB or more depending on what you install inside. Then run this command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">$ vagrant up
Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
==&amp;gt; default: Box 'kalilinux/rolling' could not be found. Attempting to find and install...
default: Box Provider: virtualbox
default: Box Version: &amp;gt;= 0
==&amp;gt; default: Loading metadata for box 'kalilinux/rolling'
default: URL: https://vagrantcloud.com/kalilinux/rolling
==&amp;gt; default: Adding box 'kalilinux/rolling' (v2018.3.1) for provider: virtualbox
default: Downloading: https://vagrantcloud.com/kalilinux/boxes/rolling/versions/2018.3.1/providers/virtualbox.box
...
==&amp;gt; default: Machine booted and ready!
==&amp;gt; default: Checking for guest additions in VM...
==&amp;gt; default: Mounting shared folders...
default: /vagrant =&amp;gt; /Users/woodbine/vagrant-boxes/kali
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Vagrant will first download the box file if it&amp;rsquo;s not in its cache, then create the Kali VM and power it on. You will see the VirtualBox UI pop up so you can use Kali normally with the &lt;strong>root/toor&lt;/strong> credentials. Vagrant veterans might notice that the VM is not headless, unlike most other Vagrant boxes. We have decided to show the GUI by default because many Kali tools require it. If you do not need the GUI, you can disable it in the &lt;strong>&lt;em>Vagrantfile&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> (see below for an example config) and run the following command to SSH to the machine as the &lt;strong>vagrant&lt;/strong> user.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">$ vagrant ssh

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This user has password-less sudo configured with the password &lt;strong>vagrant&lt;/strong>, as per Vagrant conventions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="configuration">Configuration&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The VM comes with a NAT interface pre-configured, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to edit the configuration to have Internet access from inside the VM. In addition, Vagrant will create a shared folder by default: the current directory on the host (the one containing the &lt;strong>&lt;em>Vagrantfile&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>) is available in the &lt;strong>&lt;em>/vagrant&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> directory of the guest. This directory allows you to keep data saved on the host, but easily accessible by the guest. This is a good practice, as it would allow you to quickly reset your Vagrant machine and never lose data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s see what more we can do with just a little configuration.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-ruby"># -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :
Vagrant.configure(&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;) do |config|
config.vm.box = &amp;quot;kalilinux/rolling&amp;quot;
# Create a forwarded port
config.vm.network &amp;quot;forwarded_port&amp;quot;, guest: 80, host: 8080
# Create a private network. In VirtualBox, this is a Host-Only network
config.vm.network &amp;quot;private_network&amp;quot;, ip: &amp;quot;192.168.33.10&amp;quot;
# VirtualBox specific settings
config.vm.provider &amp;quot;virtualbox&amp;quot; do |vb|
# Hide the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
vb.gui = false
# Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
vb.memory = &amp;quot;4096&amp;quot;
end
# Provision the machine with a shell script
config.vm.provision &amp;quot;shell&amp;quot;, inline: &amp;lt;&amp;lt;-SHELL
apt-get update
apt-get install -y crowbar
SHELL
end
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Add/uncomment the options inside the &lt;strong>&lt;em>Vagrantfile&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> then restart the machine with the following command for your changes to take effect:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">vagrant reload
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The provision script will only be run the first time the machine boots, but you can use one of these commands to re-run it:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">vagrant provision # provision the powered on VM
vagrant up --provision # when VM is powered off, power it on then provision
vagrant reload --provision # reboot the VM then provision
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Note that while it is possible to add a bridged network (called a &amp;ldquo;public network&amp;rdquo; in Vagrant), this is likely a bad idea as Vagrant is &lt;a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/networking/public_network.html">insecure by default&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

Kali Linux includes metapackages for password cracking, software-defined radio, wireless, web applications, and more but if you have specific needs (like most people), it&amp;rsquo;s quick and easy to define your own metapackages, which we will show in this post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before we begin, we need to install the &lt;strong>&lt;em>devscripts&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> package, which includes a number of tools and utilities for package management.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# apt install devscripts
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>In Kali, all metapackages are defined in the appropriately named &lt;strong>&lt;em>kali-meta&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> package so we can clone and modify it to suit our needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# git clone git://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/kali-meta
Cloning into 'kali-meta'...

Resolving deltas: 100% (365/365), done.
warning: remote HEAD refers to nonexistent ref, unable to checkout.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;unable to checkout&amp;rdquo; message above looks worrisome but it only means that the default branch (kali/master) needs to be checked out first, which can be done as follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# cd kali-meta/
root@kali:~/kali-meta# git checkout kali/master
Branch 'kali/master' set up to track remote branch 'kali/master' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch 'kali/master'
root@kali:~/kali-meta#
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>To create a new metapackage (or update an existing one), we need to edit the &lt;strong>&lt;em>debian/control&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> file with the package information. Each metapackage is merely a comma-separated list of package dependencies, like the one for the &lt;strong>&lt;em>kali-linux-gpu&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> shown below.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-plain">Package: kali-linux-gpu

kali-linux,
oclhashcat [amd64 i386],
pyrit,
oclgausscrack [amd64 i386],
truecrack,
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Our new metapackage will be called &amp;ldquo;kali-linux-mytools&amp;rdquo; and will install Vagrant, VirtualBox, LibreOffice, and Chromium. Our entry for this metapackage in &lt;strong>&lt;em>debian/control&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console"> root@kali:~/kali-meta# tail -n 14 debian/control

.
This metapackage depends on the tools I install most often.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With the new metapackage defined, we need to bump the version number with &amp;lsquo;dch&amp;rsquo; prior to building the package. This will launch an editor for you to enter the details of your changes in &lt;strong>&lt;em>debian/changelog&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Finally, we can proceed to build the new package with the &amp;lsquo;dpkg-buildpackage&amp;rsquo; command. Since metapackages are just lists of dependencies, the build process is very quick.&lt;/p>

All in all, we found this is a really nice and quick to configure VPN solution, and might be worth checking out.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With WireGuard added to the repos, installation is nice and easy:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt install wireguard resolvconf
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>And we are off. Next comes time for configuration. This is where WireGuard really shone for us, as it took next to nothing to get up and running.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the server, we have to generate a public/private key pair and set up an initial config file.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey &amp;gt; publickey
umask u=rwx,go= &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cat &amp;gt; /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
[Interface]
Address = 10.222.222.1/24
SaveConfig = true
ListenPort = 51820
PrivateKey = -SERVER PRIVATE KEY-
[Peer]
PublicKey = -CLIENT PUBLIC KEY-
AllowedIPs = 10.222.222.2/32
EOF
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>And we do the same process on the client to establish its key pair and config.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey &amp;gt; publickey
umask u=rwx,go= &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cat /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
[Interface]
Address = 10.222.222.2/32
PrivateKey = -CLIENT PRIVATE KEY-
DNS = 8.8.8.8
[Peer]
PublicKey = -SERVER PUBLIC KEY-
Endpoint = public.ip.of.server:51820
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
PersistentKeepalive = 21
EOF
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>These are pretty simple configs but it&amp;rsquo;s worth pointing a few things out. First off, you obviously have to put the output from the key pairs into the configs as appropriate. Additionally, the DNS line on the client is to help prevent DNS leaks from using your local default DNS server. You may or may not want to change that depending on your needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most important however is the &amp;ldquo;AllowedIPs&amp;rdquo; line. This will control what IPs do or don&amp;rsquo;t go across the VPN. In this case, we setup the client to route everything through the VPN server. We will play with this more in a bit, but let&amp;rsquo;s look at getting this basic config running.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start and stop the tunnel, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh"># The VPN can be enabled using
wg-quick up wg0
# To disable the VPN:
wg-quick down wg0
# Information about the connection can be retrieved with following command:
wg show
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>And of course, we need to enable IP masquerade and IP forwarding on the server.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">/sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
echo 1 &amp;gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>So, with this we have a traditional VPN configuration. If you are looking to just get a standard VPN setup, at this point you are done. There are some advantages to this compared to using OpenVPN, for instance this solution seems to be much faster, the config is a lot simpler, and it&amp;rsquo;s a touch more stealthy in that the server won&amp;rsquo;t respond to packets that don&amp;rsquo;t have a proper key pair linked to them. We thought however it might be interesting to change the configuration to reflect our &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux/kali-rolling-iso-of-doom/">ISO of Doom&lt;/a> config, having a client that will auto connect to the server on boot allowing the server to route through and access the client network.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wireguard-of-doom">WireGuard of DOOM!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First things first, on our client, let&amp;rsquo;s quickly set up IP forwarding and masquerading:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">/sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
echo 1 &amp;gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Great, with that done, we make a couple minor changes to our configs. First up, on the server we change the &amp;ldquo;AllowedIPs&amp;rdquo; line to have the private network on the report site. This would look like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-ini">[Interface]
Address = 10.222.222.1/24
SaveConfig = true
ListenPort = 51820
PrivateKey = -SERVER PRIVATE KEY-
[Peer]
PublicKey = -CLIENT PUBLIC KEY-
AllowedIPs = 10.200.200.2/32, 192.168.2.0/24
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With that one line changed on the server, we then tweak the clients &amp;ldquo;AllowedIPs&amp;rdquo; line to remove the option to route everything to the VPN server.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-ini">[Interface]
Address = 10.200.200.2/32
PrivateKey = -CLIENT PRIVATE KEY-
DNS = 8.8.8.8
[Peer]
PublicKey = -SERVER PUBLIC KEY-
Endpoint = public.ip.of.server:51820
AllowedIPs = 10.200.200.0/24
PersistentKeepalive = 21
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>And thats it!&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# ping 192.168.2.22
PING 192.168.2.22 (192.168.2.22) 56(84) bytes of data.

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now the VPN server can access the subnets on the other side of the WireGuard VPN.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Time will tell if WireGuard replaces OpenVPN as the VPN of choice, or if the latest buzz is just excitement of using the newest toys. In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have the ability to test it out, and use if it&amp;rsquo;s a good fit. As we have seen here, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely easy to setup, and relatively versatile in the user cases.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Custom Kali Linux Distribution</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/my-custom-kali-linux-distribution/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/my-custom-kali-linux-distribution/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/my-custom-kali-linux-distribution/images/my-custom-kali-live-build.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>We love it when community members come up with new ideas or interesting builds, and this one caught our attention. Jacek Kowalczyk hit us up on twitter with a really interesting story. His approach to tweaking Kali to be specific to his needs is exactly why this feature is so important to us and we wanted to share his story more widely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jacek&amp;rsquo;s live-build recipe was for a lightweight version of Kali using his favourite desktop environments, including some nice desktop configurations. We thought it would be best to let Jacek share his process with you step by step, in his own words:&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="jaceks-story">Jacek&amp;rsquo;s Story&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I spent a lot of time on searching for a Linux distribution that was best suited for my needs. I wanted a very lightweight system and went about testing a ton of variants (Manjaro, Debian, Ubuntu, Sparky, MX Linux, Antix, Arch, Anarchy, Antergos, Archlabs, Bunsen Labs, and many more). I also tested different desktop environments trying to find my right fit (Xfce, LXDE, Mate, LXqt, i3, openbox, fluxbox, jwm, and IceWM). Despite this exhaustive testing, I still wasn&amp;rsquo;t satisfied.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It started to become clear that for my needs, I needed a rolling release Linux that was not only lightweight, but also had good support from either a company or community. I made a long list of my favourite Linux distributions, but I still couldn&amp;rsquo;t decide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had always wanted to take part in an Open-source project and do a little development. It occurred to me that my solution could be to simply create my own setup&amp;ndash;I could take a Linux distro, install a base OS, and customize it. At first, this seemed like a great option. But what would happen if I needed to reinstall? I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to start over again on customizing my installed system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I knew I wanted to create an ISO that I could use to install my system anytime, anywhere. It would be perfectly customized for my needs fresh out of install. Because of this, I started to look for ways of customizing Debian, Arch, or Manjaro. This led me to the Kali Linux live-build config scripts. At this point, I knew I had found my solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kali Linux is a rolling distro based on Debian and has great support from the Offensive Security team as well as an active community. I also found existing scripts for i3wm provided by the Kali team. This was my starting point. I started playing with the custom packages list and later on with some chroot files to be included in the ISO. In this process, I generated over 20 ISO images until I had one I was happy with. Even now, I am still continuing to improve on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me explain how I created two variants of Kali linux&amp;ndash;one with i3wm and one with Openbox window manager.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/my-custom-kali-linux-distribution/images/screenshots_2018-09-04-170842_scrot.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="custom-kali-linux-with-i3wm-or-openbox">Custom Kali Linux with i3wm or Openbox&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I did my first setup based on the official Kali documentation for &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/live-build-a-custom-kali-iso/">live-build-config&lt;/a>. This process was:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Install Kali Linux. Use any official Kali image.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install additional packages.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Start hacking i3wm/Openbox variants. I treated these as two separate builds initially, to keep things cleaner for myself. I was doing double the work, but it was easier to track.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# apt install curl git live-build cdebootstrap
root@kali:~# git clone git://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/live-build-config.git
...
root@kali:~# cd live-build-config/kali-config
root@kali:~/live-build-config/kali-config# ls
common variant-e17 variant-i3wm variant-light variant-mate
variant-default variant-gnome variant-kde variant-lxde variant-xfce
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>For i3, I started with making my modifications in the existing &lt;strong>&lt;em>variant-i3wm&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> folder. For Openbox, I copied the &lt;strong>&lt;em>variant-i3wm&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> directory to &lt;strong>&lt;em>variant-openbox&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> and added my modifications to it&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~/live-build-config/kali-config# cp -r variant-i3wm variant-openbox
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With that in place, the next step was to edit the file &lt;strong>&lt;em>kali-config//package-lists/kali.list.chroot&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> to add the required packages I wanted. My list of packages for i3wm can be found &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/jacekkowalczyk82/my-debian/variant-i3wm/package-lists/kali.list.chroot">here&lt;/a>, and Openbox &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/jacekkowalczyk82/my-debian/package-lists/kali.list.chroot">here&lt;/a>. All config files for the livecd should be copied to &lt;strong>&lt;em>kali-config/common/includes.chroot/root/&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>. This directory is used as the livecd environment is running as the root user.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All config files for the installed file system should be copied to &lt;strong>&lt;em>kali-config/common/includes.chroot/etc/skel/&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>. The &lt;strong>&lt;em>/etc/skel&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> directory is commonly used as a template for creating user home directories, so every new user will by default have the files that are located in this directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nitrogen is an application used to setup wallpaper. The file &lt;strong>&lt;em>.config/nitrogen/bg-saved.cfg&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> defines the set wallpaper. The second file &lt;strong>&lt;em>.config/nitrogen/nitrogen.cfg&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> is the main configuration file for nitrogen and defines the directories where the wallpaper images are located. I tweaked each of these out to fit my preferences. With that in place, I then also tweaked the power manager applet by configuring &lt;strong>&lt;em>.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-power-manager.xml&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, I made a range of other customizations to personalize the system a bit more. Without going into too much detail, they were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For i3wm&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;em>kali-config/common/includes.chroot/root/.i3wm_conkyrc&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> - Configuration for conky tool. This conkyrc file is based on the conky configuration from &lt;a href="https://sparkylinux.org/">Sparky Linux&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;em>kali-config/common/includes.chroot/root/.config/i3/config&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> - The configuration file for i3wm was generated for me on the fist login to i3wm session, and I added a few changes to autostart other tools like: nitrogen, clipit, volume control, and defined my key bindings for my tools and actions (poweroff and reboot).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For Openbox&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;em>kali-config/common/includes.chroot/root/.openbox_conkyrc&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> - configuration for conky. The openbox conkyrc is a different from the one for i3wm. This one is based on the conkyrc file from &lt;a href="https://crunchbangplusplus.org/">CrunchBang++&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;em>kali-config/common/includes.chroot/root/.config/openbox/autostart&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> - Openbox autostart file defines which tools and applications should be started automatically with openbox session: (nitrogen, clipit, volume vontrol, power manager, conky). I based it on the file from CrunchBang++ also.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;em>kali-config/common/includes.chroot/root/.config/openbox/menu.xml&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> - This is the Openbox menu config, controlling what happens when you right-click on the desktop. Openbox is really unique in that this file is completely user controlled and you can run scripts in it and do other things like starting applications or even to view the status the media player application in dynamic pipe menu. Openbox is really powerful.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;em>kali-config/common/includes.chroot/root/.config/openbox/rc.xml&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> - Openbox window manager themes and keybindings. This is pretty stock, but I added there my keybindings for my favourite tools and actions like poweroff and reboot.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;em>kali-config/common/includes.chroot/root/.config/tint2/tint2rc&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> - Tint2 panel settings and launchers. Here, I added my most commonly used tools: terminal, editors, web browsers. To edit this file I used tint2conf gui application. This application allows to easily define the themes of the tint2 panel and add launchers and other items of the panel.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All the changes for i3wm can be found &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/jacekkowalczyk82/my-debian/i3/etc/skel/">here&lt;/a> and Openbox can be found &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/jacekkowalczyk82/my-debian/openbox/etc/skel/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also added the Firefox developer edition browser by downloading the install package and unpacking it into &lt;strong>&lt;em>kali-config/common/includes.chroot/opt/firefox/&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> and then added the toxic tox client to &lt;strong>&lt;em>kali-config/common/includes.chroot/opt/toxic&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>. To start up Firefox, I added also the shell script &lt;strong>&lt;em>kali-config/common/includes.chroot/usr/bin/firefox.sh&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash
echo &amp;quot;Starting firefox developer edition&amp;quot;
/opt/firefox/firefox
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Build the ISOs&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>With all that configuration out of the way, it was time for the fun part, building the ISOs!&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~/live-build-config/kali-config# ./build.sh --distribution kali-rolling --variant i3wm --verbose
root@kali:~/live-build-config/kali-config# ./build.sh --distribution kali-rolling --variant openbox --verbose
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With those running, I then just had to wait for the job to finish. In my case it took about 3 hours. The ISO files it generated were saved in the &lt;strong>&lt;em>images&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> subfolder.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="final-version">Final Version&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the final version of the configs, I decided to port my i3wm install to my Openbox build. This way, when building the Openbox config, I am getting both window managers, Openbox and i3. On the login screen, I can select the session I want. Obviously, its much easier to have one &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; ISO than have to decide between the two at install time.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We loved Jacek&amp;rsquo;s approach of identifying his needs, and then not being afraid of just jumping in and making the changes. Like many things on Linux, doing a custom install can be intimidating and look like a very complex process. But once you get in and start the process, it&amp;rsquo;s really pretty straightforward and the amount of work it can save you is amazing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Jacek for all his hard work, and being willing to share it with the community. You can see what else Jacek is up to at his page at &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/jacekkowalczyk82">his GitLab page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux 2018.3 Release</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2018-3-release/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2018-3-release/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2018-3-release/images/kali-release.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>Another edition of Hacker Summer Camp has come and gone. We had a great time meeting our users, new and old, particularly at our Black Hat and DEF CON Dojos, which were led by our great friend &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ihackstuff">@ihackstuff&lt;/a> and the rest of the &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/">Offensive Security&lt;/a> crew. Now that everyone is back home, it&amp;rsquo;s time for our third Kali release of 2018, which is available for immediate &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">download&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kali 2018.3 brings the kernel up to version 4.17.0 and while 4.17.0 did not introduce many changes, 4.16.0 had a huge number of additions and improvements including more Spectre and Meltdown fixes, improved power management, and better GPU support.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="new-tools-and-tool-upgrades">New Tools and Tool Upgrades&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since our last release, we have added a number of new tools to the repositories, including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/idb">idb&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - An iOS research / penetration testing tool&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/gdb-peda">gdb-peda&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - Python Exploit Development Assistance for GDB&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/datasploit">datasploit&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - OSINT Framework to perform various recon techniques&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/kerberoast">kerberoast&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - Kerberos assessment tools&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In addition to these new packages, we have also upgraded a number of tools in our repos including &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/aircrack-ng/">aircrack-ng&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/burpsuite/">burpsuite&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/gvm/">openvas&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/wifite/">wifite&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/wpscan/">wpscan&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>To double check your version, first make sure your Kali &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/kali-linux-sources-list-repositories/">package repositories&lt;/a> are correct.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# cat /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Then after running &lt;strong>apt -y full-upgrade&lt;/strong>, you may require a &lt;strong>reboot&lt;/strong> before checking:&lt;/p>

Our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/live-build-a-custom-kali-iso/">documentation of the process&lt;/a> is one of the most popular items on our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/">documentation site&lt;/a>, and the Kali Dojo also revolves around this topic. We love it and our users love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One roadblock of live-build has always been the fact that you need a Kali system to build a Kali system. The reason for this is that small changes in both the original debootstrap and live-build packages are needed for building a Kali ISO. In Kali, these changes are already included, however in most &lt;a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/">Debian derivatives&lt;/a>, some gentle massaging is needed to get our ISOs to build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, we have updated our docs site to include instructions on how to &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/live-build-a-custom-kali-iso/">build a custom Kali ISO&lt;/a> on other Debian based systems such as Debian 9 (Stretch/) and Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04. This will hopefully allow users running Debian derivatives to test the waters with Kali and play with one of its cooler features.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Building a custom Kali release with live-build is not as scary as it might sound so be sure to give it a chance!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="building-kali-on-non-kali-debian-based-systems">Building Kali on Non-Kali Debian Based Systems&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can easily run live-build on Debian based systems other than Kali. The instructions below have been tested to work with both Debian and Ubuntu.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, we prep the system by ensuring it is fully updated, then proceed to download the Kali archive keyring and live-build packages. The latest versions of these packages can always be found at &lt;a href="http://http.kali.org/pool/main/k/kali-archive-keyring/">http.kali.org/pool/main/k/kali-archive-keyring/&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://archive.kali.org/kali/pool/main/l/live-build/">archive.kali.org/kali/pool/main/l/live-build/&lt;/a> respectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">sudo apt update
sudo apt -y upgrade
wget https://http.kali.org/pool/main/k/kali-archive-keyring/kali-archive-keyring_2018.1_all.deb
wget https://archive.kali.org/kali/pool/main/l/live-build/live-build_20180618kali1_all.deb
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With that completed, we install some additional dependencies and the previously downloaded files.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">sudo apt -y install git live-build cdebootstrap debootstrap curl
sudo dpkg -i kali-archive-keyring_2018.1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i live-build_20180618kali1_all.deb
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With the environment all prepared, we start the live-build process by setting up the build script and checking out the build config.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">cd /usr/share/debootstrap/scripts/
(echo &amp;quot;default_mirror http://http.kali.org/kali&amp;quot;; sed -e &amp;quot;s/debian-archive-keyring.gpg/kali-archive-keyring.gpg/g&amp;quot; sid) &amp;gt; kali
sudo ln -s kali kali-rolling
cd ~
git clone git://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/live-build-config.git
cd live-build-config/
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>At this point, we have to edit the &lt;strong>&lt;em>build.sh&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> script to bypass a version check. We do this by commenting out the &amp;ldquo;exit 1&amp;rdquo; below.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh"># Check we have a good debootstrap
ver_debootstrap=$(dpkg-query -f '${Version}' -W debootstrap)
if dpkg --compare-versions &amp;quot;$ver_debootstrap&amp;quot; lt &amp;quot;1.0.97&amp;quot;; then
if ! echo &amp;quot;$ver_debootstrap&amp;quot; | grep -q kali; then
echo &amp;quot;ERROR: You need debootstrap &amp;gt;= 1.0.97 (or a Kali patched debootstrap). Your current version: $ver_debootstrap&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;amp;2
exit 1
fi
fi
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With that change made, the script should look as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh"># Check we have a good debootstrap
ver_debootstrap=$(dpkg-query -f '${Version}' -W debootstrap)
if dpkg --compare-versions &amp;quot;$ver_debootstrap&amp;quot; lt &amp;quot;1.0.97&amp;quot;; then
if ! echo &amp;quot;$ver_debootstrap&amp;quot; | grep -q kali; then
echo &amp;quot;ERROR: You need debootstrap &amp;gt;= 1.0.97 (or a Kali patched debootstrap). Your current version: $ver_debootstrap&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;amp;2
# exit 1
fi
fi
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We can now build our ISO as normal:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">sudo ./build.sh --variant light --verbose
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="no-commitment-testing">No Commitment Testing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After you get Kali built, you might want to quickly test the ISO you created. There is a fast no commitment trial you can do with QEMU. On Ubuntu, you just have to prep the system by installing a few packages:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">sudo apt -y install qemu-kvm libvirt-bin ubuntu-vm-builder bridge-utils
sudo adduser $(id -un) kvm
newgrp kvm
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With that out of the way, we will create a dynamic disk image to hold our Kali installation and then boot off our newly created ISO. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the disk size&amp;ndash;it will grow as needed so you won&amp;rsquo;t suddenly fill your drive just by creating the disk.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">qemu-img create -f qcow2 kali-disk.img 100G
kvm --name Kali -m 1024 -hda kali-disk.img -cdrom kali-linux-light-rolling-amd64.iso -boot d
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/build-kali-with-live-build-on-debian-based-systems/images/02-screen_shot_2018-07-14_at_10.53.36_am.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point, you can run a live instance of Kali, or install it to the virtual disk. If we go ahead and install it, we would then later launch the newly created VM with the command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">kvm --name Kali -m 1024 -hda kali-disk.img -boot c
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/build-kali-with-live-build-on-debian-based-systems/images/01-screen_shot_2018-07-14_at_11.05.07_am.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are few things as satisfying as running your own Linux install that you created and tweaked for what you need. With a way to build Kali on other Debian based distributions and a quick way to test it, why wait?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Secure Kali Pi 2018</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/secure-kali-pi-2018/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/secure-kali-pi-2018/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/secure-kali-pi-2018/images/secure-kali-pi-2018-1.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>We have covered how to create secure &amp;ldquo;throw-away hack boxes&amp;rdquo; using the Raspberry Pi &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/raspberry-pi-with-luks-full-disk-encryption/">before&lt;/a>, but we thought it was time to go back and take a look at the process again. With all the new Raspberry Pi models and Kali changes from when we last covered this, we found the old process was in need of some updating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a review, what we are trying to accomplish is to create a standalone &amp;ldquo;leave behind&amp;rdquo; device that, when discovered, does not make it easy to figure out what you were doing. So we use the LUKS full disk encryption along with the LUKS Nuke capability to put this together. If you have a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, or really any other model or similar device, feel free to use the instructions below to set up your own secure system. This updated process is based on our previous documentation, and updated with some &lt;a href="https://github.com/tothi/kali-rpi-luks-crypt">community&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/NicoHood/NicoHood.github.io/wiki/Raspberry-Pi-Encrypt-Root-Partition-Tutorial">suggestions&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="overview-of-the-process">Overview of the process&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before we dive into the tech of what we are going to try to accomplish, let&amp;rsquo;s take a quick look at our goals on setting up our Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ (henceforth called &amp;ldquo;RPi&amp;rdquo;):&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Create a normal Kali Linux RPi installation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prepare the system for encrypted boot with remote disk unlock&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create an initramfs configured with Dropbear and SSH keys to allow the unlock to occur&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Backup existing data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Configure the encrypted partitions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Restore our data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Configure LUKS Nuke&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hack away!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This might seem like a lot, but its really pretty straightforward and once completed, we will be left with a RPi that will boot, get an IP from DHCP, and Dropbear will allow us to connect via SSH to provide the LUKS key. This permits us to run the RPi headless, but still keeping our data secure. Then down the road when we are done with it, we can retrieve it or remote in and destroy our data with LUKS NUKE.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="preparing-the-base-system">Preparing the Base system&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To start with, we need to write out the RPi image to a SD card. We won&amp;rsquo;t get into that here, but you can find information on doing so &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/raspberry-pi/">in our docs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that out of the way, we insert the SD card into the RPi and let it boot up. On first boot, it will resize the SD card and reboot, after that it&amp;rsquo;s ready for use. Next, we connect over SSH, update Kali, and install a few packages we will need.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt update
apt dist-upgrade
apt install cryptsetup lvm2 busybox dropbear
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="doing-the-magic-fu">Doing the Magic-Fu&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The RPi is all setup and ready to go so let&amp;rsquo;s get our hands dirty and dive into things. Take note, once we start this process, we are going to be changing a number of critical files on our RPi installation. It is important to not reboot the device or otherwise shut down the system until you are ready or you will be left with a system that won&amp;rsquo;t boot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First off, we need to append a line to &lt;strong>&lt;em>/boot/config.txt&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">echo initramfs initramfs.gz followkernel &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /boot/config.txt
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Next, we want to validate where our actual root filesystem device is located:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# cat /etc/fstab
# proc /proc proc defaults 0 0
/dev/mmcblk0p1 /boot vfat defaults 0 2
/dev/mmcblk0p2 / ext4 defaults,noatime 0 1
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Take special note that our root filesystem lives at &lt;strong>&lt;em>/dev/mmcblk0p2&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>. This is what we will use for our examples going forward, so be sure to update the instructions with whatever value you received on your system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that we know our root filesystem location, we will edit the &lt;strong>&lt;em>/boot/cmdline.txt&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> . By default, it contains the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# cat /boot/cmdline.txt
dwc_otg.fiq_fix_enable=2 console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait rootflags=noload net.ifnames=0
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Take note of the entry reading &lt;em>root=/dev/mmcblk0p2&lt;/em>. We are going to update it with a &lt;em>cryptdevice&lt;/em> value:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">root=/dev/mapper/crypt cryptdevice=/dev/mmcblk0p2:crypt
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With the change made, our file looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# cat /boot/cmdline.txt
dwc_otg.fiq_fix_enable=2 console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mapper/crypt cryptdevice=/dev/mmcblk0p2:crypt rootfstype=ext4 rootwait rootflags=noload net.ifnames=0
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We also need to edit &lt;strong>&lt;em>/etc/fstab&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> and replace the device where our root filesystem currently is to be &lt;strong>&lt;em>/dev/mapper/crypt&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# cat /etc/fstab
# proc /proc proc defaults 0 0
/dev/mmcblk0p1 /boot vfat defaults 0 2
/dev/mapper/crypt / ext4 defaults,noatime 0 1
#/dev/mmcblk0p2 / ext4 defaults,noatime 0 1
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Next, we need to create a &lt;strong>&lt;em>/etc/crypttab&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> file containing the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">crypt /dev/mmcblk0p2 none luks
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Take special care here&amp;ndash;the separators between the entries &lt;em>have to be tabs&lt;/em>, not spaces. Now, before we start to create our initramsfs, we need to do a sly little hack to force cryptsetup to be included. To do this, we will create a fake LUKS filesystem. We &lt;strong>dd&lt;/strong> an empty file, format it as LUKS, mount it, and put a filesystem on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/fakeroot.img bs=1M count=20
cryptsetup luksFormat /tmp/fakeroot.img
cryptsetup luksOpen /tmp/fakeroot.img crypt
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/crypt
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t worry too much about setting a strong password for this fakeroot as it is only used in this instance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-ssh-and-initramfs">Setting up SSH and Initramfs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now we are on the home stretch. This part is really cool, as normally when a system running LUKS starts up, the boot process pauses to allow you to unlock the HDD with your LUKS key. If you are running a headless system, that&amp;rsquo;s not especially convenient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To work around that, we are going to configure Dropbear to start up, allow you to authenticate with SSH, and then connect you to provide your LUKS password&amp;ndash;all from remote!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We start out by creating a file at &lt;strong>&lt;em>/etc/dropbear-initramfs/authorized_keys&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> that contains:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">command=&amp;quot;export PATH='/sbin:/bin/:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin'; /scripts/local-top/cryptroot &amp;amp;&amp;amp; kill -9 \`ps | grep -m 1 'cryptroot' | cut -d ' ' -f 3\` &amp;amp;&amp;amp; exit&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Its important to note, this needs to be all on one line. No line breaks in there at all. If you have this set up right, it should look similar to this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# cat /etc/dropbear-initramfs/authorized_keys
command=&amp;quot;export PATH='/sbin:/bin/:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin'; /scripts/local-top/cryptroot &amp;amp;&amp;amp; kill -9 `ps | grep -m 1 'cryptroot' | cut -d ' ' -f 3` &amp;amp;&amp;amp; exit&amp;quot; ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC... user@system
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Next, we make a small change to &lt;strong>&lt;em>/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-premount/dropbear&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>. This change is due to the fact that we need to slow down Dropbear to ensure that networking is set up before Dropbear kicks in. At the end of the file, where it reads:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh"># On NFS mounts, wait until the network is configured. On local mounts,
# configure the network in the background (in run_dropbear()) so someone
# with console access can enter the passphrase immediately. (With the
# default ip=dhcp, configure_networking hangs for 5mins or so when the
# network is unavailable, for instance.)
[ &amp;quot;$BOOT&amp;quot; != nfs ] || configure_networking
run_dropbear &amp;amp;
echo $! &amp;gt;/run/dropbear.pid
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We want to add in a simple &lt;strong>sleep&lt;/strong> statement like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">[ &amp;quot;$BOOT&amp;quot; != nfs ] || configure_networking
sleep 5
run_dropbear &amp;amp;
echo $! &amp;gt;/run/dropbear.pid
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With that completed, we are finally ready to create our initramfs!&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">mkinitramfs -o /boot/initramfs.gz
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Before proceeding, we ensure that our customized changes made it into the new initramfs:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">lsinitramfs /boot/initramfs.gz | grep cryptsetup
lsinitramfs /boot/initramfs.gz | grep authorized
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With that validated, we ensure all changes are written to disk and shut the RPi down.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">sync &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sync
init 0
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="backup-and-restore">Backup and Restore&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Remove the SD card from your RPi and return to the system you initially used to write the SD card. Let&amp;rsquo;s prepare the environment:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">ls -al /mnt/{chroot,backup,encrypted}
# Please make sure there is nothing here first before you move on, otherwise you will have a bad day.
rm -rf /mnt/{chroot,backup,encrypted}
mkdir -p /mnt/{chroot,backup,encrypted}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now insert the SD card and validate the device ID. In our case, the device is &lt;strong>&lt;em>/dev/sdc2&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> but yours might be different so adjust as necessary on your system. We mount the device and make a backup of the filesystem:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">mount /dev/sdc2 /mnt/chroot/
rsync -avh /mnt/chroot/* /mnt/backup/
umount /mnt/chroot
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Once that is done, we delete the existing 2nd partition on the SD card and recreate an empty one, which we set up for LUKS encryption.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">echo -e &amp;quot;d\n2\nw&amp;quot; | fdisk /dev/sdc
echo -e &amp;quot;n\np\n2\n\n\nw&amp;quot; | fdisk /dev/sdc
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With the partitions updated, we reload them by running &lt;strong>partprobe&lt;/strong> and then configure LUKS on the new partition:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">cryptsetup -v -y --cipher aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 --key-size 256 luksFormat /dev/sdc2
cryptsetup -v luksOpen /dev/sdc2 crypt
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/crypt
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With that out of the way, we restore the root filesystem backup to the now encrypted partition.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">mount /dev/mapper/crypt /mnt/encrypted/
rsync -avh /mnt/backup/* /mnt/encrypted/
sync
umount /mnt/encrypted/
cryptsetup luksClose /dev/mapper/crypt
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="testing-it-out">Testing it out&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can now put the SD card back into the RPi and let it start up. If you watch the boot, you should see Dropbear start up. At that point, you should be able to SSH into the system and unlock the drive.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# ssh -o &amp;quot;UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null&amp;quot; root@10.42.42.94
The authenticity of host '10.42.42.94 (10.42.42.94)' can't be established.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '10.42.42.94' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
Please unlock disk /dev/mmcblk0p2 (crypt):
cryptsetup (crypt): set up successfully
Connection to 10.42.42.94 closed.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The versatility of these little devices combined with the power of Kali never ceases to amaze us. Now we are left with a nice headless system we can operate with relative confidence that, even if it&amp;rsquo;s discovered, it won&amp;rsquo;t be too simple to get into.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But we aren&amp;rsquo;t done yet! Let&amp;rsquo;s add in some &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/nuke-kali-linux-luks/">LUKS NUKE&lt;/a> functionality:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">cryptsetup luksDump /dev/mmcblk0p2
cryptsetup luksAddNuke /dev/mmcblk0p2
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now when we SSH in, we have one password we can enter to allow the SD card to unlock and continue the boot process, and another that destroys the LUKS header, making the data inaccessible. If you end up in a situation where you can&amp;rsquo;t retrieve the device, this option to burn the device could be very helpful. If you want to be really fancy, you could also combine this with &lt;a href="https://kali.training/topic/exercise-chapter-5-mid-course-project/">making the RPi into a wireless access point&lt;/a>, allowing you to remote in and unlock/nuke the system all through a wireless connection. This is very useful if you won&amp;rsquo;t have ongoing direct access to the network the RPi will be attached to.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Installing PowerShell on Kali Linux</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/installing-powershell-on-kali-linux/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/installing-powershell-on-kali-linux/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/installing-powershell-on-kali-linux/images/powershell-on-kali-linux-v3.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;h2 id="update-nov-2019">&lt;strong>UPDATE NOV 2019&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This post is out of date as of 2019 as powershell has been added to the primary repos. Just do a:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt -y install powershell
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>And you will have powershell on your system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="old-post">Old Post&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You may already be aware that you can safely &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/advanced-package-management-in-kali-linux/">add external repositories to your Kali Linux installation&lt;/a> but you may not be aware that one of the many repositories available online includes one from Microsoft that includes &lt;a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell">PowerShell&lt;/a>. The repository is for Debian but its packages install perfectly well on Kali, as we will show in this post.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="powershell-package-installation-in-kali">PowerShell Package Installation in Kali&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We begin by installing the necessary dependencies, most of which should already be installed in your Kali installation by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt -y install curl gnupg apt-transport-https
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Next, we need to download and add the public repository GPG key so APT will trust the packages and alert you to any issues with package signatures.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | apt-key add -
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With the GPG key added, we proceed to add the Microsoft package repository to its own package list file under &lt;strong>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/&lt;/strong> and update the list of available packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">echo &amp;quot;deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-debian-stretch-prod stretch main&amp;quot; &amp;gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/powershell.list
apt update
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Finally, we proceed to install the powershell package.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt -y install powershell
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="running-powershell">Running PowerShell&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When the package installation completes, running &lt;strong>pwsh&lt;/strong> will start up PowerShell, presenting us with the familiar &amp;ldquo;PS&amp;rdquo; prompt.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# pwsh

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re new to PowerShell, one of the first things you will likely want to do is update the built-in help, which can be done by running the &lt;strong>Update-Help&lt;/strong> Cmdlet. This may take a little while to complete but only really needs to be run once in a rare while.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">PS /root&amp;gt; Update-Help

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>As you might expect, you won&amp;rsquo;t find all the commands you&amp;rsquo;re used to when using PowerShell on Windows but all of the core modules are present and the code is under constant development and improvement.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">PS /root&amp;gt; Get-Process -Name gnome*

&lt;p>One of the surprising things you &lt;em>can&lt;/em> do however, is use PowerShell to send a reverse shell to a Netcat listener. We came across a &lt;a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/staaldraad/204928a6004e89553a8d3db0ce527fd5/raw/fe5f74ecfae7ec0f2d50895ecf9ab9dafe253ad4/mini-reverse.ps1">small PowerShell reverse shell&lt;/a> online and much to our surprise, it happily connected back to our listener.&lt;/p>

It also includes much &lt;a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f6705bf959efac87bca76d40050d342f1d212587">better support for AMD GPUs&lt;/a> and support for &lt;a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=33e63acc119d15c2fac3e3775f32d1ce7a01021b">AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization&lt;/a>, which allows for encrypting virtual machine memory such that even the hypervisor can&amp;rsquo;t access it.&lt;/p>

Fortunately, as of &lt;em>metasploit-framework_4.16.34-0kali2&lt;/em>, you can now make use of all these scripts directly as we have included links to all of them in the PATH, each of them prepended with &lt;strong>&lt;em>msf-&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

With the ease of installation that APT provides, we have the choice amongst tens of thousands of packages but the downside is, we have tens of thousands of packages. Finding out what packages are available and finding the one(s) we want can be a daunting task, particularly for newcomers to Linux. In this post, we will cover three utilities that can be used to search through the haystack and help you take advantage of the vast Open-source ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="apt-cache">apt-cache&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Of the various interfaces available to search for packages, apt-cache is the most basic and rudimentary of them all. However, it is also the interface we tend to use most often because it is fast, easy, and efficient. By default, apt-cache searches for a given term in package names as well as their descriptions. For example, knowing that all &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/">Kali Linux metapackages&lt;/a> include &amp;lsquo;kali-linux&amp;rsquo; in their names, we can easily search for all of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# apt-cache search kali-linux
kali-linux - Kali Linux base system
kali-linux-all - Kali Linux - all packages
kali-linux-forensic - Kali Linux forensic tools
kali-linux-full - Kali Linux complete system
kali-linux-gpu - Kali Linux GPU tools
kali-linux-nethunter - Kali NetHunter tools
kali-linux-pwtools - Kali Linux password cracking tools
kali-linux-rfid - Kali Linux RFID tools
kali-linux-sdr - Kali Linux SDR tools
kali-linux-top10 - Kali Linux Top 10 tools
kali-linux-voip - Kali Linux VoIP tools
kali-linux-web - Kali Linux webapp assessment tools
kali-linux-wireless - Kali Linux wireless tools
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>In many cases, apt-cache returns far too many results because it searches in package descriptions. The searches can be limited to the package names themselves by using the &lt;strong>&lt;em>--names-only&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> option.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# apt-cache search nmap | wc -l
37
root@kali:~# apt-cache search nmap --names-only
dnmap - Distributed nmap framework
fruitywifi-module-nmap - nmap module for fruitywifi
nmap-dbgsym - debug symbols for nmap
python-libnmap - Python 2 NMAP library
python-libnmap-doc - Python NMAP Library (common documentation)
python3-libnmap - Python 3 NMAP library
libnmap-parser-perl - parse nmap scan results with perl
nmap - The Network Mapper
nmap-common - Architecture independent files for nmap
zenmap - The Network Mapper Front End
nmapsi4 - graphical interface to nmap, the network scanner
python-nmap - Python interface to the Nmap port scanner
python3-nmap - Python3 interface to the Nmap port scanner
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Since apt-cache has such wonderfully greppable output, we can keep filtering results until they&amp;rsquo;re at a manageable number.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# apt-cache search nmap --names-only | egrep -v '(python|perl)'
dnmap - Distributed nmap framework
fruitywifi-module-nmap - nmap module for fruitywifi
nmap - The Network Mapper
nmap-common - Architecture independent files for nmap
nmap-dbgsym - debug symbols for nmap
nmapsi4 - graphical interface to nmap, the network scanner
zenmap - The Network Mapper Front End
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You can further filter down the search results but once you start chaining together a few commands, that&amp;rsquo;s generally a good indication that it&amp;rsquo;s time to reach for a different tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="aptitude">aptitude&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>&lt;em>aptitude&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> application is a very close cousin of &lt;strong>&lt;em>apt&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>&lt;em>apt-get&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> except it also includes a very useful ncurses interface. It is not included in Kali by default but it can quickly be installed as follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt -y install aptitude
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>After installation, running aptitude without any options will launch the ncurses interface. One of the first things you will notice is that you can quickly and easily browse through packages by category, which greatly helps with sorting through the thousands of available packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/finding-packages-for-kali-linux/images/aptitude0.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To search for a package, either press the &lt;strong>/&lt;/strong> character or select &amp;lsquo;Find&amp;rsquo; under the &amp;lsquo;Search&amp;rsquo; menu. As you enter your query, the package results will be updated dynamically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/finding-packages-for-kali-linux/images/aptitude1.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve located a package of interest, you can mark it for installation with the &lt;strong>+&lt;/strong> character or to remove/deselect it, the &lt;strong>-&lt;/strong> character.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/finding-packages-for-kali-linux/images/aptitude2.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point, you can keep searching for other packages to mark for installation or removal. When you&amp;rsquo;re ready to install, press the &lt;strong>g&lt;/strong> key to view the summary of the actions to be taken.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/finding-packages-for-kali-linux/images/aptitude3.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re satisfied with the proposed changes, press &lt;strong>g&lt;/strong> again and aptitude will complete the package installations as usual.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-internet">The Internet&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you want to restrict your searches to tools that are packaged by the Kali team, the easiest way to do so is probably by using the Google &lt;em>site&lt;/em> search operator.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hopefully, this post will help you answer whether or not a certain tool is available in Kali (or Debian).

For the past few weeks, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working with the Microsoft WSL team to get Kali Linux introduced into the Microsoft App Store as an official WSL distribution and today we&amp;rsquo;re happy to &lt;a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2018/03/05/kali-linux-for-wsl/">announce&lt;/a> the availability of the &amp;ldquo;Kali Linux&amp;rdquo; Windows application. For Windows 10 users, this means you can simply enable WSL, &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/kali-linux/9pkr34tncv07">search for Kali&lt;/a> in the Windows store, and install it with a single click. This is especially exciting news for penetration testers and security professionals who have limited toolsets due to enterprise compliance standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While running Kali on Windows has a few drawbacks to running it natively (such as the lack of raw socket support), it does bring in some very interesting possibilities, such as extending your security toolkit to include a whole bunch of command line tools that are present in Kali. We will update our blog with more news and updates regarding the development of this app as it&amp;rsquo;s released.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to take this opportunity to thank the WSL team at Microsoft, and specifically &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tara_msft">@tara_msft&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benhillis">@benhillis&lt;/a> for all the assistance and guidance with which this feat would not be possible. We hope you enjoy WSL&amp;rsquo;d Kali on Windows 10!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now, a quick guide on getting Kali installed from the Microsoft App Store:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="getting-kali-linux-installed-on-wsl">Getting Kali Linux Installed on WSL&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick description of the setup and installation process. For an easier copy / paste operation, these are the basic steps taken:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1. Update your Windows 10 machine. Open an administrative PowerShell window and install the Windows Subsystem with this one-liner. A reboot will be required once finished.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-powershell">Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>2. Once rebooted, open the Windows App store and search for the &amp;ldquo;Kali Linux&amp;rdquo; application, or alternatively click &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/kali-linux/9pkr34tncv07">here&lt;/a> to go there directly. Install the app and enjoy Kali!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="updating-kali-linux-on-wsl">Updating Kali Linux on WSL&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Updating Kali Linux on WSL is no different from any other instance of Kali:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick video of the process:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="installing-penetration-testing-tools-on-kali">Installing Penetration Testing tools on Kali&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Installing tools from the Kali Linux repository is usually done via &lt;em>&lt;strong>apt&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> commands. For example, to install the Metasploit Framework, you can simply:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt-get update
apt-get install metasploit-framework
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> Some Kali tools are identified by anti-virus software as malware. One way to deal with this situation is to allow anti-virus exceptions on the directory in which the Kali chroot resides in. The following video walks you through this process:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="recovering-from-a-failed-kali-wsl-instance">Recovering from a failed Kali WSL instance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Sometimes, you can inadvertently kill your Kali WSL instance, due to an overzealous command, an unintentional action, or even due to Kali or WSL bugs. If this happens, here is a quick recovery guide to get back on top of things. &lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong>: this process will wipe your Kali WSL chroot, and re-extract a new copy. Any changes made to the filesystem will be gone, and reset to default.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="food-for-thought">Food for thought&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The availability of the Kali Linux platform and toolset on Windows 10 brings with it many exciting possibilities which we haven&amp;rsquo;t even begun to grasp - here&amp;rsquo;s one example that got us scratching our heads. While not officially supported by WSL yet, we&amp;rsquo;ve tested running a desktop manager such as XFCE on WSL&amp;rsquo;d Kali&amp;hellip;and it seems to work quite well:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux 2018.1 Release</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2018-1-release/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2018-1-release/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2018-1-release/images/kali-release.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>Welcome to our first release of 2018, Kali Linux 2018.1. This fine release contains all &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/changelog_page.php">updated packages and bug fixes&lt;/a> since our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2017-3-release/">2017.3 release&lt;/a> last November. This release wasn&amp;rsquo;t without its challenges&amp;ndash;from the &lt;a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Meltdown and Spectre&lt;/a> excitement (patches will be in the 4.15 kernel) to a couple of other &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=4483">nasty&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=4488">bugs&lt;/a>, we had our work cut out for us but we prevailed in time to deliver this latest and greatest version for your installation pleasure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="kernel-updated-to-414">Kernel Updated to 4.14&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Kali Linux 2018.1 has a shiny new 4.14.12 kernel. New kernels always have a lot of new features and the 4.14 kernel is no exception, although two new features really stand out.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;em>AMD Secure Memory Encryption Support&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> - Secure Memory Encryption is a feature that will be in newer AMD processors that enables automatic encryption and decryption of DRAM. The addition of this features means that systems will no longer (in theory) be vulnerable to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack">cold-boot attacks&lt;/a> because, even with physical access, the memory will be not be readable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;em>Increased Memory Limits&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> - Current (and older) 64-bit processors have a limit of 64 TB of physical address space and 256 TB of virtual address space (VAS), which was sufficient for more than a decade but with some server hardware shipping with 64 TB of memory, the limits have been reached. Fortunately, upcoming processors will enable &lt;a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/717293/">5-level paging&lt;/a>, support for which is included in the 4.14 kernel. In short, this means that these new processors will support 4 PB of physical memory and 128 PB of virtual memory. That&amp;rsquo;s right, &lt;em>petabytes&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="package-updates">Package Updates&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In addition to the updated kernel, we have also upgraded a number of packages, including &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/zaproxy/">zaproxy&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/securesocketfunneling/ssf">secure-socket-funneling&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/pixiewps/">pixiewps&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/seclists/">seclists&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/burpsuite/">burpsuite&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://dbeaver.io/">dbeaver&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/reaver/">reaver&lt;/a>. If you already have a Kali installation, you can easily get the latest version of these tools along with everything else that has been updated:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt full-upgrade
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Note that if you haven&amp;rsquo;t updated your Kali installation in some time (tsk2), you will like receive a GPG error about the repository key being expired (ED444FF07D8D0BF6). Fortunately, this issue is quickly resolved by running the following as root:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">wget -q -O - https://archive.kali.org/archive-key.asc | apt-key add
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h4 id="hyper-v-updates">Hyper-V Updates&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>For those of you using Hyper-V to run the &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/">Kali virtual machines&lt;/a> provided by Offensive Security, you will find that the Hyper-V virtual machine is now &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn282285(v=ws.11)">generation 2&lt;/a>, which means it&amp;rsquo;s now UEFI-based and expanding/shrinking HDD is supported. The Hyper-V &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/supported-debian-virtual-machines-on-hyper-v">integration services&lt;/a> are also included, which supports Dynamic Memory, Network Monitoring/Scaling, and Replication.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re new to the fight, or a seasoned pro, don&amp;rsquo;t stop training&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This statement, like the video that introduced it, has real punch. We did this on purpose to get you fired up, excited about your training, and to kickstart your journey. If it worked, and you&amp;rsquo;re in the fight, welcome aboard! If you haven&amp;rsquo;t jumped in for whatever reason, we want to introduce you to the plethora of resources we&amp;rsquo;ve made available to help you master Kali Linux, the penetration testing distribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ve likely heard about the first, official Kali Linux book: Kali Linux Revealed, Mastering The Penetration Testing Distribution available from OffSec Press. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a sales pitch. We&amp;rsquo;ve made the book available for free in both online HTML and PDF versions because we love you. But wait, there&amp;rsquo;s more. We&amp;rsquo;ve also made chapter exercises available online at &lt;a href="https://kali.training">Kali.training&lt;/a> (after free registration) so you can test your knowledge and get some hands-on experience as you work through the book. We&amp;rsquo;ve also created our first Kali Linux certification, the Kali Linux Certified Professional (KLCP), so you can take your training to the next level. This is where some folks get either overwhelmed or confused, so let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what all this is, exactly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-linux-revealed---whats-that">Kali Linux Revealed - What&amp;rsquo;s That&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Kali Linux Revealed. Whether you buy the (fairly-priced) physical book from retailers like &lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Kali-Linux-Revealed-Penetration-Distribution/dp/0997615605">Amazon&lt;/a>, download the free PDF, or follow along with the &lt;a href="https://kali.training/">online version of the book&lt;/a>, you&amp;rsquo;re getting exactly the same content. There is no difference. So why are we selling a book and giving it away? The fact is, we&amp;rsquo;re not trying to make a business by selling books. We wrote the book to provide an official manual for Kali Linux, to provide a body of knowledge for the KLCP, and to improve the knowledge base of the Kali community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The follow-on exercises at &lt;a href="https://kali.training">Kali.training&lt;/a> help solidify your knowledge and give you practical hands-on experience. All of this will help prepare you for the ultimate test: the KLCP&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="klcp">KLCP?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So what is the KLCP, exactly? Once you&amp;rsquo;ve studied (and not simply read or skimmed) the book and worked through the exercises, you&amp;rsquo;re probably ready for the KLCP. Consisting of a 90-minute, 80-question multiple choice exam (proctored by &lt;a href="https://home.pearsonvue.com/kali">Pearson Vue&lt;/a>), the KLCP is the foundational Kali Linux certification.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-inside">What&amp;rsquo;s Inside&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>All of this is centered around the content in the Kali Linux Revealed print, online, and PDF books, so let&amp;rsquo;s dive into what&amp;rsquo;s covered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been mentioned that we&amp;rsquo;ve provided a resource that&amp;rsquo;s too basic for some and too advanced for others. That&amp;rsquo;s fair because we provide a somewhat gentle introduction for new users, thoroughly cover all Kali Linux features, and then delve into some fairly advanced topics as well. So, yes, it&amp;rsquo;s a fairly broad range.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start things off, we discuss the basics of Kali Linux in the first few chapters. In the first chapter, we share the history of Kali Linux, explain the relationship with Debian, talk about Kali features, policies and use cases, and discuss what Kali is best used for. We follow this up in chapter two with details on how to download and verify Kali Linux, how to create a bootable Kali USB, and how to set up a virtual machine. In chapter three, we discuss Linux fundamentals, talk about terminology and basic commands, and touch on system logging and troubleshooting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you register on Kali.training, you can dive in to end-of-chapter exercises. Working through these exercises, you will:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Set up a new VM&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Boot Kali Live&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Inspect kernel boot options&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Download (and verify) Kali&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install Kali on USB and VM&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Modify kernel boot parameters&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Practice Linux job control&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Search and manipulate files&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enumerate and manipulate hardware settings&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is the turning point of the table of contents, where beginners are starting to get pumped and advanced users have dismissed this as &amp;ldquo;useless beginner stuff&amp;rdquo;. While many are quite happy bouncing around and using the book as a reference, if you&amp;rsquo;re a serious student or a professional seeking to better your skills or nail your KLCP, you should not simply dismiss or skip any of the chapters. There really is a lot of good material for users at every level and anything in the book is fair game for the KLCP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/your-kali-training-journey-starts-here/images/kali-training-post.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="continue-the-journey">Continue The Journey&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Continuing with our journey, we step into chapter four where we cover installation requirements, show you how to install Kali as a standard install, ARM install, unattended install and as a fully encrypted installation with LVM and LUKS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve never strayed from the standard installation path, you&amp;rsquo;re missing out on the power of unattended installation and the ultimate security of encryption with LUKS &amp;ldquo;nuke&amp;rdquo;. You&amp;rsquo;ll get hands-on at Kali.training with a fully encrypted install, an unattended install and a standard as well as a fully customized ARM install on a Raspberry Pi. The final exercise in this chapter has you not only building a &amp;ldquo;Kali Pi&amp;rdquo; but mounting and chrooting the file system to make post-installation changes. This gives you extreme flexibility, takes you off the path of a standard burned-image installation and is especially eye-opening for new users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In chapter five, we dive into service and user configuration and management, then follow this up in chapter six with tips on troubleshooting Kali Linux and self-diagnosing and getting help with any aspect of your installation. As we roll into chapter seven, we&amp;rsquo;ll dig into security topics and cover firewall and log configuration and monitoring, package auditing and several host-based intrusion detection tools. While most of this may seem like basic Linux system administration, the fact is that Kali is really a killer secure base OS and each of these skills is important for building a strong foundational knowledge of Kali.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you pass through these chapters and tackle the exercises, you will:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Add new user accounts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Configure network without Network Manager&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spin up hostapd as WAP&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Configure Apache and PostgreSQL&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install masscan with a custom web interface&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a custom PI access point with hostapd&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create and test firewall rules&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Learn to detect and prevent password brute forcing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install and modify a host-based IDS system&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is yet another turning point of the book. We&amp;rsquo;ve covered basic Kali installation and use, stepped into administrative roles and gotten even the most basic user up to a decent foundational level of knowledge. Our advanced users may be frustrated, wondering when they get their turn to play. That time is now. The next three chapters are the meat of Kali Linux Revealed. They are the longest and most densely packed chapters in the entire book and each chapter contains a ton of cool stuff that will appeal to even the most advanced user.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="into-the-fray">Into The Fray&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We jump right into the fray in chapter eight as we examine Debian Package Management. Debian is a robust, mature, operating system that allowed us to take Kali to the next level as a distribution. We gained so many advanced features when we moved to Debian, and in this chapter we start to lay out the foundations of what makes these features possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve done anything with Kali, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely used apt to update your installation. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to just blow off this process, follow the directions, and move on. But what happens behind the scenes with Debian&amp;rsquo;s package management tools is impressive, powerful, and flexible. We go behind-the-scenes and talk about all the components that make this possible. For example, do you understand the difference between dpkg, apt, and apt-get? What about aptitude and synaptic? Each of these utilities has powerful functionality and we get in deep so we can get into some powerful features in the following chapters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of chapter eight, you dive into the exercises where you will:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Install bleeding edge software, like the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create custom packages, including a custom-built offline installation of Nessus that includes all plugins&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install and configure packages from foreign architectures&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install Windows-based programs in Kali Linux&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In chapter nine, we will show you how to modify Kali packages, recompile the Kali kernel, and build custom Kali live ISO images. Custom packages are especially cool, allowing you to create a package, share it, deploy it, and even roll back your changes if you need to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we dive into the exercises, you will:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Build custom Kali live ISO images, like an much-upgraded version of Angela&amp;rsquo;s live USB from Mr. Robot&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Build an unencrypted live Kali USB&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Build an encrypted live Kali USB with LUKS &amp;ldquo;nuke&amp;rdquo; allowing you to obliterate your data with a specific decryption password.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fork your own metapackage containing exactly the tools you want to deploy&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As we cruise in to chapter ten, we&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to install Kali Linux over the network, including options for complete unattended installation. We&amp;rsquo;ll also show you how to create a full-featured enterprise installation of Kali that allows you to deploy Kali &amp;ldquo;minions&amp;rdquo; that you can control from a central &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo;. Finally, we will show you how to create a custom package repository that you can use to deploy your own completely customized packages. When you pull together the skills in these final chapters, you will be able to create custom Kali installations with your own package builds and configuration options. You will even have the power to build custom live instances primed to do anything you want after booting. You&amp;rsquo;ll be able to network-install machines with completely unattended installation options, stand up your own package repositories with custom tools for rapid deployment, and monitor, update, and control deployed Kali instances without installing any additional tools on top of Kali.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="take-the-next-step">Take The Next Step&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At this level, the true power of Kali Linux is revealed and you have truly &amp;ldquo;mastered the penetration testing distribution&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kali Linux Revealed, the resources at &lt;a href="https://kali.training/">Kali.training&lt;/a> and the KLCP encompass so much cool stuff, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty hard to summarize, but we hope you&amp;rsquo;ll take the next step in your journey and join us at Kali.training!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali on the Windows Subsystem for Linux</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-on-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-on-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-on-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/images/kali-on-windows-10-kali-post.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update&lt;/strong> : &lt;strong>This post is outdated.&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>For a better way of getting Kali Linux on Windows 10, install&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-in-the-windows-app-store/">Kali Linux from the App store&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re always on the prowl for novel environments to run Kali on, and with the introduction of the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">Windows Subsystem for Linux&lt;/a> (WSL) in Windows 10, new and exciting possibilities have surfaced. After all, if the WSL can support Ubuntu, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too hard to incorporate another Debian-like distribution, right? This is especially true with the &lt;a href="https://github.com/RoliSoft/WSL-Distribution-Switcher">&lt;strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux Distribution Switcher&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> utility.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-on--windows-really">Kali on &amp;hellip; Windows? Really?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While this setup of Kali on Windows is not optimal due to various environmental restrictions (such as the lack of raw sockets and lack of customised Kali kernel), there are still many situations where having Kali Linux alongside your Windows 10 machine can be beneficial. One example that comes to mind is consolidation of workspaces, especially if Windows is your main working environment. Other useful situations that crossed our minds were standardizing tools and scripts to run across multiple environments, quick porting of Linux penetration testing command line tools to Windows, etc. For example, below is a screenshot of running the Metasploit Framework from Kali Linux, over WSL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-on-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/images/Kali_Linux_WSL_msf.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-the-environment">Setting up the Environment&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While the setup is described well over at the WSL Distribution Switcher &lt;a href="https://github.com/RoliSoft/WSL-Distribution-Switcher">README&lt;/a> file, we&amp;rsquo;ve made a quick 4-minute video to walk you through the setup and installation process. For an easier copy / paste operation, these are the basic steps taken:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1. Update your Windows 10 machine. Open an administrative PowerShell window and install the Windows Subsystem with this one-liner. A reboot will be required once finished.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-plain">Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>2. Once rebooted, open a command line shell and run the following commands to install the default Ubuntu environment. This will lay down the foundations for our Kali install.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">lxrun /install
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>3. Setup and install the WSL Switcher, download a Kali base, and extract it to disk:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">git clone https://github.com/RoliSoft/WSL-Distribution-Switcher.git
cd WSL-Distribution-Switcher
python get-prebuilt.py kalilinux/kali-linux-docker
python install.py rootfs_kalilinux_kali-linux-docker_latest.tar.gz
lxrun /setdefaultuser root
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>4. Now that Kali is set up on your Windows 10 machine, you can interact with it by running the &amp;ldquo;bash&amp;rdquo; command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">bash
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>5. At this point, you&amp;rsquo;re inside Kali and you can use it as you normally do&amp;ndash;install packages, use tools, etc. We strongly recommend first running an update and upgrade:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">export LANG=C
apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Without further ado, here&amp;rsquo;s the video demonstration of the setup described above:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux 2017.3 Release</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2017-3-release/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2017-3-release/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2017-3-release/images/kali-release.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>We are pleased to announce the immediate availability of &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali Linux 2017.3&lt;/a>, which includes all patches, fixes, updates, and improvements since our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2017-2-release/">last release&lt;/a>. In this release, the kernel has been updated to 4.13.10 and it includes some notable improvements:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=eef914a9eb5eb83e60eb498315a491cd1edc13a1">CIFS now uses SMB 3.0 by default&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=e08ac99fa2a25626f573cfa377ef3ddedf2cfe8f">EXT4 directories can now contain 2 billion entries instead of the old 10 million limit&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=3c4d7559159bfe1e3b94df3a657b2cda3a34e218">TLS support is now built into the kernel itself&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In addition to the new kernel and all of the updates and fixes we pull from Debian, we have also updated our packages for &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/reaver/">Reaver&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/pixiewps/">PixieWPS&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/burpsuite/">Burp Suite&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/tools/removed-tools/">Cuckoo&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/set/">The Social Engineering Toolkit&lt;/a>, and more. Take a look at the &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/changelog_page.php">Kali Changelog&lt;/a> to see what else has been updated in this release, or read on to see what else is new.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-tool-additions">New Tool Additions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since our last release in September, we&amp;rsquo;ve added four new tools to the distribution, most of which focus on the always-lucrative Open-source information gathering. These new tools are not included in the default installation but after an &amp;lsquo;apt update&amp;rsquo;, you can check out and install the ones that interest you. We, of course, think they&amp;rsquo;re all interesting and hope you do as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="inspy">InSpy&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/inspy/">InSpy&lt;/a> is a small but useful utility that performs enumeration on LinkedIn and can find people based on job title, company, or email address.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="massive-maltego-metamorphosis">Massive Maltego Metamorphosis&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of our favourite applications in Kali has always been Maltego, the incredible Open-source information gathering tool from Paterva, and the equally incredible Casefile. These two applications had always been separate entities (get it?) but as of late September, they are now combined into one amalgamated application that still allows you to run Maltego Community Edition and Casefile, but now it also works for those of you with Maltego Classic or Maltego XL licenses. As always, the tools perform wonderfully and look great doing it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As usual, we have updated our standard ISO images, VMware and VirtualBox virtual machines, ARM images, and cloud instances, all of which can be found via the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali Downloads&lt;/a> page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you find any bugs, please open a ticket on our &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">bug tracker&lt;/a>. We keep an eye on social media but there is no substitute for a &lt;a href="https://kali.training/topic/filing-a-good-bug-report/">well-written bug report&lt;/a> and many bugs that get reported to us end up getting fixed in Debian, which then benefits all of its &lt;a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census">derivatives&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Configuring and Tuning OpenVAS in Kali Linux</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/configuring-and-tuning-openvas-in-kali-linux/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/configuring-and-tuning-openvas-in-kali-linux/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/configuring-and-tuning-openvas-in-kali-linux/images/tuning-openvas-kali.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>Users often request the addition of vulnerability scanners to Kali, most notably the ones that begin with &amp;ldquo;N&amp;rdquo;, but due to licensing constraints, we do not include them in the distribution. Fortunately, Kali includes the very capable &lt;a href="https://www.openvas.org/">OpenVAS&lt;/a>, which is free and Open-source. Although we briefly &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/openvas-vulnerability-scanning/">covered OpenVAS in the past&lt;/a>, we decided to devote a more thorough post to its setup and how to use it more effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vulnerability scanners often have a poor reputation, primarily because their role and purpose is misunderstood. Vulnerability scanners scan for vulnerabilities&amp;ndash;they are not magical exploit machines and should be one of many sources of &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/kali-meta/#kali-tools-information-gathering">information&lt;/a> used in an assessment. Blindly running a vulnerability scanner against a target will almost certainly end in disappointment and woe, with dozens (or even hundreds) of low-level or uninformative results.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="system-requirements">System Requirements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The main complaint we receive about OpenVAS (or any other vulnerability scanner) can be summarized as &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s too slow and crashes and doesn&amp;rsquo;t work and it&amp;rsquo;s bad, and you should feel bad&amp;rdquo;. In nearly every case, slowness and/or crashes are due to &lt;em>insufficient system resources&lt;/em>. OpenVAS has tens of thousands of signatures and if you do not give your system enough resources, particularly RAM, you will find yourself in a world of misery. Some commercial vulnerability scanners require a &lt;em>minimum&lt;/em> of 8GB of RAM and recommend even more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OpenVAS does not require anywhere near that amount of memory but the more you can provide it, the smoother your scanning system will run. For this post, our Kali virtual machine has &lt;em>3 CPUs and 3GB of RAM&lt;/em>, which is generally sufficient to scan small numbers of hosts at once.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="initial-openvas-setup-in-kali">Initial OpenVAS Setup in Kali&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>OpenVAS has many &lt;a href="https://www.openvas.org/software.html">moving parts&lt;/a> and setting it up manually can sometimes be a challenge. Fortunately, Kali contains an easy-to-use utility called &amp;lsquo;openvas-setup&amp;rsquo; that takes care of setting up OpenVAS, downloading the signatures, and creating a password for the admin user.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This initial setup can take &lt;em>quite a long while&lt;/em>, even with a fast Internet connection so just sit back and let it do its thing. At the end of the setup, the automatically-generated password for the admin user will be displayed. Be sure to &lt;em>save this password somewhere safe&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# openvas-setup
ERROR: Directory for keys (/var/lib/openvas/private/CA) not found!
ERROR: Directory for certificates (/var/lib/openvas/CA) not found!

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="dealing-with-setup-errors">Dealing with Setup Errors&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Occasionally, the &amp;lsquo;openvas-setup&amp;rsquo; script will display errors at the end of the NVT download similar to the following.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-plain">(openvassd:2272): lib kb_redis-CRITICAL **: get_redis_ctx: redis connection error: No such file or directory
(openvassd:2272): lib kb_redis-CRITICAL **: redis_new: cannot access redis at '/var/run/redis/redis.sock'
(openvassd:2272): lib kb_redis-CRITICAL **: get_redis_ctx: redis connection error: No such file or directory
openvassd: no process found
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If you are unfortunate enough to encounter this issue, you can run &amp;lsquo;openvas-check-setup&amp;rsquo; to see what component is causing issues. In this particular instance, we receive the following from the script.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-plain">...
ERROR: The number of NVTs in the OpenVAS Manager database is too low.
FIX: Make sure OpenVAS Scanner is running with an up-to-date NVT collection and run 'openvasmd --rebuild'.
...
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The &amp;lsquo;openvas-check-setup&amp;rsquo; scipt detects the issue and even provides the command to run to (hopefully) resolve the issue. After rebuilding the NVT collection as recommended, all checks are passed.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# openvasmd --rebuild
root@kali:~# openvas-check-setup

...
It seems like your OpenVAS-9 installation is OK.
...
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="managing-openvas-users">Managing OpenVAS Users&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you need (or want) to create additional OpenVAS users, run &amp;lsquo;openvasmd&amp;rsquo; with the &lt;strong>--create-user&lt;/strong> option, which will add a new user and display the randomly-generated password.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# openvasmd --create-user=dookie
User created with password 'yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyy'.
root@kali:~# openvasmd --get-users
admin
dookie
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re anything like us, you will forget to save the admin password or accidentally delete it. Fortunately, changing OpenVAS user passwords is easily accomplished with &amp;lsquo;openvasmd&amp;rsquo; and the &lt;strong>--new-password&lt;/strong> option.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# openvasmd --user=dookie --new-password=s3cr3t
root@kali:~# openvasmd --user=admin --new-password=sup3rs3cr3t
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="starting-and-stopping-openvas">Starting and Stopping OpenVAS&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Network services are disabled by default in Kali Linux so if you haven&amp;rsquo;t configured OpenVAS to start at boot, you can start the required services by running &amp;lsquo;openvas-start&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# openvas-start
Starting OpenVas Services
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>When the services finish initializing, you should find TCP ports 9390 and 9392 listening on your loopback interface.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# ss -ant
State Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address:Port Peer Address:Port
LISTEN 0 128 127.0.0.1:9390 *:*
LISTEN 0 128 127.0.0.1:9392 *:*
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Due to the strain on system resources, you will likely want to stop OpenVAS whenever you are done using it, especially if you are not using a dedicated system for vulnerability scanning. OpenVAS can be stopped by running &amp;lsquo;openvas-stop&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# openvas-stop
Stopping OpenVas Services
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="using-the-greenbone-security-assistant">Using the Greenbone Security Assistant&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Greenbone Security Assistant is the OpenVAS web interface, available on your local machine (after starting OpenVAS) at &lt;strong>&lt;em>https://localhost:9392&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>. After accepting the self-signed certificate, you will be presented with the login page and once authenticated, you will see the main dashboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/configuring-and-tuning-openvas-in-kali-linux/images/openvas1.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="configuring-credentials">Configuring Credentials&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Vulnerability scanners provide the most complete results when you are able to provide the scanning engine with credentials to use on scanned systems. OpenVAS will use these credentials to log in to the scanned system and perform detailed enumeration of installed software, patches, etc. You can add credentials via the &amp;ldquo;Credentials&amp;rdquo; entry under the &amp;ldquo;Configuration&amp;rdquo; menu.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/configuring-and-tuning-openvas-in-kali-linux/images/openvas4.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="target-configuration">Target Configuration&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>OpenVAS, like most vulnerability scanners, can scan for remote systems but it&amp;rsquo;s a vulnerability scanner, not a port scanner. Rather than relying on a vulnerability scanner for identifying hosts, you will make your life much easier by using a dedicated network scanner like &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/nmap/">Nmap&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/masscan/">Masscan&lt;/a> and import the list of targets in OpenVAS.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# nmap -sn -oA nmap-subnet-86 192.168.86.0/24
root@kali:~# grep Up nmap-subnet-86.gnmap | cut -d &amp;quot; &amp;quot; -f 2 &amp;gt; live-hosts.txt
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Once you have your list of hosts, you can import them under the &amp;ldquo;Targets&amp;rdquo; section of the &amp;ldquo;Configuration&amp;rdquo; menu.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/configuring-and-tuning-openvas-in-kali-linux/images/openvas6.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/configuring-and-tuning-openvas-in-kali-linux/images/openvas7.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="scan-configuration">Scan Configuration&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Prior to launching a vulnerability scan, you should fine-tune the Scan Config that will be used, which can be done under the &amp;ldquo;Scan Configs&amp;rdquo; section of the &amp;ldquo;Configuration&amp;rdquo; menu. You can clone any of the default Scan Configs and edit its options, disabling any services or checks that you don&amp;rsquo;t require. If you use Nmap to conduct some prior analysis of your target(s), you can save hours of vulnerability scanning time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/configuring-and-tuning-openvas-in-kali-linux/images/openvas8.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="task-configuration">Task Configuration&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Your credentials, targets, and scan configurations are setup so now you&amp;rsquo;re ready to put everything together and run a vulnerability scan. In OpenVAS, vulnerability scans are conducted as &amp;ldquo;Tasks&amp;rdquo;. When you set up a new task, you can further optimize the scan by either increasing or decreasing the concurrent activities that take place. With our system with 3GB of RAM, we adjusted our task settings as shown below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/configuring-and-tuning-openvas-in-kali-linux/images/openvas9.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With our more finely-tuned scan settings and target selection, the results of our scan are much more useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/configuring-and-tuning-openvas-in-kali-linux/images/openvas10.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automating-openvas">Automating OpenVAS&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the lesser-known features of OpenVAS is its &lt;a href="https://www.openvas.org/src-doc/openvas-cli/index.html">command-line interface&lt;/a>, which you interact with via the &amp;lsquo;omp&amp;rsquo; command. Its usage isn&amp;rsquo;t entirely intuitive but we aren&amp;rsquo;t the only fans of OpenVAS and we came across a couple of basic scripts that you can use and extend to automate your OpenVAS scans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first is &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/mgeeky/a038f809dff4d308db94f5f657908da7">openvas-automate.sh by mgeeky&lt;/a>, a semi-interactive Bash script that prompts you for a scan type and takes care of the rest. The scan configs are hard-coded in the script so if you want to use your customized configs, they can be added under the &amp;ldquo;targets&amp;rdquo; section.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# apt -y install pcregrep

&lt;p>With the wide range of options available in OpenVAS, we were only really able to just scratch the surface in this post but if you take your time and effectively tune your vulnerability scans, you will find that the bad reputation of OpenVAS and other vulnerability scanners is undeserved. The number of connected devices in our homes and workplaces is increasing all the time and managing them becomes more of a challenge. Making effective use of a vulnerability scanner can make that management at least a little bit easier.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali on KRACK</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-on-krack/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-on-krack/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-on-krack/images/kali-krack-wpa2-attack.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;h2 id="wpa2-key-reinstallation-attack-or-krack-attack">WPA2 Key Reinstallation AttaCK or KRACK attack&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Recently, Mathy Vanhoef of imec-DistriNet, KU Leuven, discovered a serious weakness in WPA2 known as the &lt;a href="https://www.krackattacks.com/">Key Reinstallation AttaCK (or KRACK) attack&lt;/a>. Their overview, Key Reinstallation Attacks: Breaking WPA2 by forcing nonce reuse, and research paper (&lt;a href="https://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/ccs2017.pdf">Key Reinstallation Attacks: Forcing Nonce Reuse in WPA2, co-authored by Frank Piessens&lt;/a>) have created quite a stir in our industry because the press touts that it &amp;ldquo;breaks Wi-Fi&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There have been numerous articles written about this vulnerability, and we won&amp;rsquo;t rehash them here. However, we want to take a moment to talk about how this relates to Kali Linux, from a defensive, testing, and detection standpoint.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="is-kali-linux-vulnerable">Is Kali Linux Vulnerable?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>From a defensive standpoint, if you&amp;rsquo;re keeping up with your Kali Linux rolling updates (via a simple &amp;ldquo;apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt upgrade), you&amp;rsquo;re already patched against this vulnerability thanks to patches in &lt;a href="https://packages.debian.org/buster/wpasupplicant">wpasupplicant&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://packages.debian.org/buster/hostapd">hostapd&lt;/a> (both at 2.4-1.1). To be entirely clear: an &lt;em>updated&lt;/em> version of Kali Linux is &lt;em>not vulnerable&lt;/em> to this attack. You are keeping your Kali Linux system up-to-date, aren&amp;rsquo;t you?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-test-for-the-vulnerability">How do I test for the Vulnerability?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>With your Kali system updated, there are also some steps you can take to test for this vulnerability on your access points. &lt;a href="https://github.com/vanhoefm/krackattacks-test-ap-ft">Mathy Vanhoef recently released a script&lt;/a> that can be run from Kali Linux to test whether or not your access point (AP) is affected by &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-13082">CVE-2017-13082&lt;/a> or specifically the Key Reinstall in FT Handshake vulnerability found in 802.11r devices. The script requires that you authenticate to the access point, but bear in mind that it may incorrectly flag an AP as vulnerable due to &amp;ldquo;benign retransmissions of data frames&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-can-i-detect-attacks">How can I Detect Attacks?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KismetWireless">Dragorn&lt;/a>, the author of the amazing &lt;a href="https://kismetwireless.net/">Kismet&lt;/a>, has released lots of great information on the subject on &lt;a href="https://www.kismetwireless.net/year-archive">his blog&lt;/a>, including excellent info about detecting KRACK attacks using Kismet. He explains that the &lt;a href="https://github.com/kismetwireless/kismet">git-master version of Kismet&lt;/a> is, &amp;ldquo;introducing alerts to attempt to detect a Krack-style attack&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-on-krack/images/krack-alert.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These alerts track spoofed access points, multichannel access points, zero-length keys, zero nonce in a handshake, and nonce retransmission, all factors that could point to a KRACK attack in progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dragorn warns that since Kismet hops channels, it could miss handshake packets and therefore miss the attack. In addition, he says that false positives are still possible despite Kismet&amp;rsquo;s packet de-duplication and that once real proof-of-concept code is released for KRACK, the logic of these alerts may need to be adjusted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dragorn also explains that, &amp;ldquo;it looks like you can still trip the kismet nonce detection w/ a packet flagged in the frame control as a retransmit&amp;rdquo; but despite these drawbacks, Kismet is still a decent system for detection of this and other Wi-Fi protocol attacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-on-krack/images/kistmet-krack-detect.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="to-install-the-git-master-version-of-kismet-on-kali-linux-follow-these-steps">To install the git-master version of Kismet on Kali Linux, follow these steps&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>First, tell networkmanager to ignore the Wi-Fi device by adding these lines:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-ini">[keyfile]
unmanaged-devices=interface-name:wlan0
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>to &lt;code>/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, restart NetworkManager:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# systemctl restart NetworkManager
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Next, install updates and the git-master version of Kismet:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# apt update
root@kali:~# apt upgrade
root@kali:~# git clone https://www.kismetwireless.net/git/kismet.git
root@kali:~# apt install build-essential libmicrohttpd-dev libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev libcap-dev libpcap-dev libncurses5-dev libnm-dev libdw-dev libsqlite3-dev
root@kali:~# cd kismet
root@kali:~# ./configure
root@kali:~# make
root@kali:~# make suidinstall
root@kali:~# /usr/local/bin/kismet_capture_tools/kismet_cap_linux_wifi --list
root@kali:~# kismet -c wlan0
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Next you can browse to &lt;strong>&lt;em>http://localhost:2501&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> to view the Kismet interface and any alerts. Be sure to log in with the credentials found in &lt;code>~/.kismet/kismet_httpd.conf&lt;/code> to get full functionality. You can also build and run the capture tools on separate machines, allowing you to monitor from several endpoints and view the alerts on a single centralized server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, this vulnerability is not the end of the world. As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/grifter801/status/920132813680193538">@grifter801&lt;/a> puts it, this vulnerability encourages this shocking approach: &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Patch your stuff. Use 2FA. Use HTTPS.&amp;quot;&lt;/em> We couldn&amp;rsquo;t agree more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also encourage you to consider the defensive, testing, and detection perspectives of any new vulnerability to help you become more aware of the finer details of the vulnerability, gain insight about it, and become part of the solution.&lt;/p>

APT often works so well that many users don&amp;rsquo;t pay any particular attention to it other than to perhaps search for and install programs and (hopefully) update their system regularly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For most standard users, making use of APT this way is perfectly normal but we like to think that people who use Kali Linux are not standard users (in a good way) and so we are devoting this post to telling how you to get better use of APT and how to take advantage of the wide ecosystem of packages that are available, while keeping your Kali system stable and happy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many people will tell you that you should not rely on a package manager at all and instead, you should compile everything from scratch because you will learn more that way. While it&amp;rsquo;s certainly true that you will learn a lot, especially as you start out, building everything by hand will quickly devolve into tedium when you could be spending your time hacking or learning something new, preferably both.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll show you how you can safely add additional package repositories to your Kali installation, how to upgrade and downgrade them, and how to ensure all of these repositories live in harmony. APT is very powerful and will evaluate the available packages from all sources as a whole when it formulates its solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="adding-package-sources-to-kali-linux">Adding Package Sources to Kali Linux&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you want to make your future self happy, you should not directly edit &lt;strong>&lt;em>/etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> directly. For each new package repository you add to your system, create a new file with a descriptive name (like &lt;strong>&lt;em>debian-unstable.list&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>) under &lt;strong>&lt;em>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>. By leaving the original &lt;strong>&lt;em>sources.list&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> file untouched, if Kali needs to update it, it won&amp;rsquo;t interrupt you during the update, asking you which version of the file to keep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, we are going to add the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/bleeding-edge-kali-repositories/">Kali Bleeding-Edge&lt;/a> repository and the Debian &lt;a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUnstable">Unstable&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianExperimental">Experimental&lt;/a> repositories.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-kali-bleeding-edge-repository">The kali-bleeding-edge Repository&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The kali-bleeding-edge repository contains a number of tools that are very popular and change very frequently (even daily). It would be impractical and time-consuming to manually create and test updated packages so the packages in this repository are generated automatically whenever the upstream source changes. On the positive side, it means you are never more than 24 hours behind the upstream project but on the downside, these packages are not tested so you need to be aware that the packages in this repository may break from time to time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can add the repo and update the list of available packages as follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">echo &amp;quot;deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-bleeding-edge main contrib non-free&amp;quot; &amp;gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bleeding-edge.list
apt update
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>To install a package from kali-bleeding-edge, you need to append the repository name to the package name:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt install dnsrecon/kali-bleeding-edge
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Fortunately, APT makes it an easy to downgrade back to the kali-rolling version of a particular package at any time, so there is no need to fear the packages in the kali-bleeding-edge repository. If you find that a package is broken in kali-bleeding-edge, you can revert back to the kali-rolling version in the same manner:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt install dnsrecon/kali-rolling
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="the-debian-unstable-and-experimental-repositories">The Debian Unstable and Experimental Repositories&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Kali Linux is a &lt;a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census">derivative of Debian&lt;/a> Testing, which has more up-to-date software than Debian Stable. For even more recent software, there is the Debian Unstable distribution, which is a rolling development version of Debian, containing the most recent packages. When you encounter a bug in a Debian package, there might be a fixed version in the Debian Unstable repository so it is a good idea to add it to your Kali system. As with kali-bleeding-edge, the packages in Unstable may break from time to time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Debian Experimental is yet another repository that contains packages that are under development. The packages in this repository are very current but can also be very buggy, more so than kali-bleeding-edge or Debian Unstable. APT will only install packages from this repository if you explicitly request them and you can always downgrade if things don&amp;rsquo;t work out.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">echo &amp;quot;deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian unstable main contrib non-free&amp;quot; &amp;gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list
echo &amp;quot;deb http://deb.debian.org/debian experimental main&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list
apt update
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>As with the kali-bleeding-edge packages, if you want to install packages from unstable or experimental, append the repository name to the end of the package name as shown below.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="determining-package-priorities">Determining Package Priorities&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order to determine what packages get installed, APT has &lt;em>priorities&lt;/em> assigned for all package sources, with the highest priority number taking precedence. A package with a priority of &lt;em>0&lt;/em> will never be installed and a package with a priority over &lt;em>1000&lt;/em> will always be installed, even if it means downgrading the package.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is all well and good for APT but how can you, the user, see what the priority is of a given package? Enter the little-known &amp;lsquo;apt-cache&amp;rsquo; command and its &amp;lsquo;policy&amp;rsquo; option, which displays all of your configured repositories and their priorities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You will note that kali-rolling, as the default distribution, has the highest priority at 990, meaning its packages take precedence over all others (which is what you want as a Kali user), followed by Debian unstable at 500, kali-bleeding-edge at 100, and lastly, experimental, with a lowly priority of 1. To see how these priorities apply to a given package, take a look at &lt;a href="http://sqlmap.org/">sqlmap&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="setting-the-default-distribution">Setting the Default Distribution&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now that you have some extra repositories added to your system, you will want to begin exploring and installing new packages, but before you do, it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to tell APT what your &lt;em>default distribution&lt;/em> is, which for Kali Linux users, is &amp;ldquo;kali-rolling&amp;rdquo;. This way your system won&amp;rsquo;t upgrade to some other distribution without your consent. Configure your default distribution by adding &amp;ldquo;APT::Default-Release &amp;ldquo;kali-rolling&amp;rdquo;;&amp;rdquo; to &lt;strong>&lt;em>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/local&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# cat /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/local
APT::Default-Release &amp;quot;kali-rolling&amp;quot;;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With your default distribution configured, any time you run &amp;lsquo;apt full-upgrade&amp;rsquo;, it will apply the upgrade to kali-rolling, helping keep your system stable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="reducing-upgrade-prompts">Reducing Upgrade Prompts&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you use any Debian derivative for a significant amount of time, you will come across a prompt while running &amp;lsquo;apt upgrade&amp;rsquo; asking you about a configuration file and whether you want to keep the local version, use the new version, or compare them. More often than not, you will find yourself accepting the default, making these interruptions wasteful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can avoid these prompts by updating your &lt;strong>&lt;em>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/local&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> file with &amp;lsquo;DPkg::options { &amp;ldquo;&amp;ndash;force-confdef&amp;rdquo;; &amp;ldquo;&amp;ndash;force-confold&amp;rdquo;; }&amp;rsquo; as shown below. This line tells APT to try to choose by itself if the files have not changed (&amp;ndash;force-confdef) and if the files are different, keep the existing version (&amp;ndash;force-confold).&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# cat /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/local
DPkg::options { &amp;quot;--force-confdef&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;--force-confold&amp;quot;; }
APT::Default-Release &amp;quot;kali-rolling&amp;quot;;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="pinning-package-versions">Pinning Package Versions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Occasionally, you will find some application that needs a specific version of a particular package and will not work with any other. Other times, an update to one package might adversely affect other tools. This happened to us recently with an update to the devscripts package, which was preventing us from building Kali packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, APT allows you to &lt;em>pin&lt;/em> a package to a particular version by setting its priority to &lt;em>1001&lt;/em> in &lt;strong>&lt;em>/etc/apt/preferences&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>. For example, to tell APT to hold the devscripts package at version 2.16.x, you would add the following.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">Package: devscripts
Pin: version 2.16.*
Pin-Priority: 1001
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="additional-resources">Additional Resources&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this post, we have only been able to scratch the surface of how you can extend APT far beyond the default Kali or Debian ecosystem. The solver algorithms are very effective and running into issues is rare, so you need not fear exploring other repositories. To learn more about APT and how to bend it to your will, we encourage you to refer to &lt;a href="https://kali.training/topic/introduction-to-apt/">Kali Linux Revealed&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/apt.html">The Debian Administrator&amp;rsquo;s Handbook&lt;/a>, both of which contain a wealth of information, tips, and tricks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux 2017.2 Release</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2017-2-release/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2017-2-release/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2017-2-release/images/kali-2017-2-release.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>We are happy to announce the release of Kali Linux 2017.2, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">available now&lt;/a> for your downloading pleasure. This release is a roll-up of all updates and fixes since our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2017-1-release/">2017.1 release&lt;/a> in April. In tangible terms, if you were to install Kali from your 2017.1 ISO, after logging in to the desktop and running &amp;lsquo;apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt full-upgrade&amp;rsquo;, you would be faced with something similiar to this daunting message:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-plain">1399 upgraded, 171 newly installed, 16 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Need to get 1,477 MB of archives.
After this operation, 1,231 MB of additional disk space will be used.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>That would make for a whole lot of downloading, unpacking, and configuring of packages. Naturally, these numbers don&amp;rsquo;t tell the entire tale so read on to see what&amp;rsquo;s new in this release.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="new-and-updated-packages-in-kali-20172">New and Updated Packages in Kali 2017.2&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In addition to all of the standard security and package updates that come to us via &lt;a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting">Debian Testing&lt;/a>, we have also added more than a dozen new tools to the repositories, a few of which are listed below. There are some really nice additions so we encourage you to &amp;lsquo;apt install&amp;rsquo; the ones that pique your interest and check them out.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://github.com/fnord0/hURL">hurl&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - a useful little hexadecimal and URL encoder/decoder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://github.com/ryhanson/phishery">phishery&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - phishery lets you inject SSL-enabled basic auth phishing URLs into a .docx Word document&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://github.com/arthepsy/ssh-audit">ssh-audit&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - an SSH server auditor that checks for encryption types, banners, compression, and more&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/tools/removed-tools/">apt2&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - an Automated Penetration Testing Toolkit that runs its own scans or imports results from various scanners, and takes action on them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound">bloodhound&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - uses graph theory to reveal the hidden or unintended relationships within Active Directory&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec">crackmapexec&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - a post-exploitation tool to help automate the assessment of large Active Directory networks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://dbeaver.io/">dbeaver&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - powerful GUI database manager that supports the most popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite, and many more&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://github.com/x90skysn3k/brutespray">brutespray&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - automatically attempts default credentials on discovered services&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>On top of all the new packages, this release also includes numerous package updates, including &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/jd-gui/">jd-gui&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/dnsenum/">dnsenum&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/edb-debugger/">edb-debugger&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/wpscan/">wpscan&lt;/a>, watobo, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/burpsuite/">burpsuite&lt;/a>, and many others. To check out the full list of updates and additions, refer to the &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/changelog_page.php">Kali changelog&lt;/a> on our bug tracker.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ongoing-integration-improvements">Ongoing Integration Improvements&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Beyond the new and updated packages in this release, we have also been working towards improving the overall integration of packages in Kali Linux. One area in particular is in program usage examples. Many program authors assume that their application will only be run in a certain manner or from a certain location. For example, the SMBmap application has a binary name of &amp;lsquo;smbmap&amp;rsquo; but if you were to look at the usage example, you would see this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">$ python smbmap.py -u jsmith -p password1 -d workgroup -H 192.168.0.1
$ python smbmap.py -u jsmith -p 'aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:da76f2c4c96028b7a6111aef4a50a94d' -H 172.16.0.20
$ python smbmap.py -u 'apadmin' -p 'asdf1234!' -d ACME -h 10.1.3.30 -x 'net group &amp;quot;Domain Admins&amp;quot; /domain'
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If you were a novice user, you might see these examples, try to run them verbatim, find that they don&amp;rsquo;t work, assume the tool doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, and move on. That would be a shame because smbmap is an excellent program so we have been working on fixing these usage discrepancies to help improve the overall fit and finish of the distribution. If you run &amp;lsquo;smbmap&amp;rsquo; in Kali 2017.2, you will now see this output instead:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">$ smbmap -u jsmith -p password1 -d workgroup -H 192.168.0.1
$ smbmap -u jsmith -p 'aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:da76f2c4c96028b7a6111aef4a50a94d' -H 172.16.0.20
$ smbmap -u 'apadmin' -p 'asdf1234!' -d ACME -h 10.1.3.30 -x 'net group &amp;quot;Domain Admins&amp;quot; /domain'
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We hope that small tweaks like these will help reduce confusion to both veterans and newcomers and it&amp;rsquo;s something we will continue working towards as time goes on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="learn-more-about-kali-linux">Learn More About Kali Linux&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the time since the release of 2017.1, we also released our first book, Kali Linux Revealed, in both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kali-Linux-Revealed-Penetration-Distribution/dp/0997615605">physical&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://kali.training/">online&lt;/a> formats. If you are interested in going far beyond the basics, really want to learn how Kali Linux works, and how you can leverage its many advanced features, we encourage you to check it out. Once you have mastered the material, you will have the foundation required to pursue the &lt;a href="https://home.pearsonvue.com/kali">Kali Linux Certified Professional&lt;/a> certification.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="kali-iso-downloads-virtual-machines-and-arm-images">Kali ISO Downloads, Virtual Machines and ARM Images&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Kali Rolling 2017.2 release can be downloaded via our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">official Kali Download page&lt;/a>. This release, we have also updated our &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/">Kali Virtual Images&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/">Kali ARM Images&lt;/a> downloads. As always, if you already have Kali installed and running to your liking, all you need to do in order to get up-to-date is run the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt update
apt dist-upgrade
reboot
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We hope you enjoy this fine release as much as we enjoyed making it!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VMware Fusion Kali USB Boot</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;h2 id="vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot">VMware Fusion Kali USB Boot&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the fun, and often necessary, features of Kali Linux is the ability to create really killer, completely customized live-boot installations. Normally stored on a USB drive, these installations put the power of Kali Linux in your pocket, ready to launch whenever you need it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Building Kali live USB installations is pretty straightforward, whether you&amp;rsquo;re going for plain installation, building in persistence so you can store files, going fully-encrypted (even arming a self-destruct passphrase), or customizing and building your own tailored install.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the process of testing your USB install can be a bit of a pain, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re a Mac user. You could, under certain circumstances, reboot your Mac and boot from the USB, but that can be a real hassle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be great if you could use a product like &lt;a href="https://www.vmware.com/ca/products/fusion.html">VMware Fusion&lt;/a> (which is the industry-leading product and does a fabulous job running every other OS on our Macs already) to boot and test your live USBs? No rebooting. No fuss. Just pop it in and let it fly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That seemed like a great idea but the Fusion product has been in flux for awhile, and seems to get &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; treatment from VMware. The company seems to think that Mac users don&amp;rsquo;t need extensive options, like a checkbox for EFI booting. Instead, they set it up so that if your guest is Mac or Windows-based, it will automatically do an EFI boot for you. That&amp;rsquo;s helpful, but if you create a Mac or Windows guest and try to boot from the USB, you&amp;rsquo;ll get the Kali boot screen, followed by a boot-halting message that the USB doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain a version of Mac or Windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of this flux, and core differences between Fusion and the rest of the VMware line, this EFI USB booting issue had us stumped. A few workarounds have been introduced, like booting a specialized VM that would attempt an EFI boot, but they had their own problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thankfully, Fusion has matured enough that now we can get under the hood and make this process work. Here&amp;rsquo;s how you do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create a new custom VM:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image1.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Select &amp;ldquo;Linux&amp;rdquo; -&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Debian 8.x 64-bit&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image2.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create a new virtual disk. Settings do not matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image3.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Click &amp;ldquo;Finish&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image4.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Give it a snappy name:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image5.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shut down the machine. Go to &amp;ldquo;Virtual Machine&amp;rdquo; -&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Settings&amp;rdquo; -&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Processor and Memory&amp;rdquo;, set memory to at least 2048 MB, and set cores to &amp;ldquo;2&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image6.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, head to &amp;ldquo;Settings&amp;rdquo; -&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Display&amp;rdquo;, and check &amp;ldquo;Accelerate 3D Graphics&amp;rdquo;. This is optional, but it really helps the performance of your Kali experience. &amp;ldquo;Use full resolution..&amp;rdquo; is also optional.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image7.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Head to &amp;ldquo;USB Devices&amp;rdquo;. Insert your Kali USB and set USB compatibility to USB 3.0 (if you have a USB 3.0 compatible system and drive). Note that USB-C, dongles or not, make no difference here. Just make sure that if you&amp;rsquo;re using a USB-C device, select USB 3.0 compatibility. Select &amp;ldquo;Connect to Linux&amp;rdquo; as the &amp;ldquo;Plug in Action&amp;rdquo; and set the machine to &amp;ldquo;Connect to this virtual machine&amp;rdquo; when it is plugged in:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image8.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go to &amp;ldquo;Settings&amp;rdquo; -&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Disks&amp;rdquo;. Select &amp;ldquo;Advanced Options&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Remove Hard Disk&amp;rdquo;, sending it to the Trash. You won&amp;rsquo;t need it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image9.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to enable EFi booting. There is no GUI setting for this so, you need to find this VM on your hard drive. Virtual hard drives are stored by default in &lt;strong>&lt;em>~/Documents//Virtual Machines.localized&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>. Change to the directory containing this VM. Ours is called &amp;ldquo;Kali USB Boot&amp;rdquo; so the full path is &lt;strong>&lt;em>~/Documents//Virtual Machines.localized/Kali USB Boot.vmwarevm&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&amp;quot;. Within that directory is a &lt;strong>&lt;em>.vmx&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> file named after the VM. Ours is called &lt;strong>&lt;em>Kali USB Boot.vmx&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>. Edit that file with your favourite editor and insert the following line:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>firmware = &amp;quot;efi&amp;quot;&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Be careful with copy and paste. If you paste this line into the editor, you may get funny &amp;ldquo;Mac quotes&amp;rdquo; and this will break the VM. Your &lt;strong>&lt;em>.vmx&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> file should look something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image10.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, power on your VM, and it should boot to Kali Linux:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image11.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="troubleshooting-usb-connections">Troubleshooting USB Connections&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you run into problems, you have a few options. First, power off your VM. Go to &amp;ldquo;Settings&amp;rdquo; -&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;USB Devices&amp;rdquo; and leave this settings screen up next to your powered-off VM. (You can also expand your toolbar and look at the USB icon). Now, power on the VM. Immediately, you should see the USB Settings screen update with a check next to your USB device:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image12.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t get a check mark, this means that your Mac has grabbed the USB drive. Power off your VM, eject the drive from the Mac, and power on the VM again with the USB settings screen up. You should see the check mark and get the Kali boot screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image13.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="troubleshooting-efi">Troubleshooting EFI&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When booting with EFI, your boot screen should look like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image14.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This indicates that EFI is enabled. If it&amp;rsquo;s not, triple-check that you entered the firmware line correctly in the &lt;strong>&lt;em>.vmx&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> file. Note that in some cases, this EFI Network check may hang. Simply pressing ESC within the VM nudges the process along.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a normal boot, you can click inside the VM screen and press ESC &lt;em>quickly&lt;/em> just as the VMware logo is appearing on the screen to get to the Boot Manager:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image15.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From here, you can select &amp;ldquo;EFI Internal Shell&amp;rdquo; to get into the shell. If you get something like this, missing an fs0 map, then EFI doesn&amp;rsquo;t see your USB drive. If this is the case, power off the virtual machine, unplug the USB, start the VM, and immediately after pressing start, insert the drive, looking for the checkmark in settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If everything goes well, you&amp;rsquo;re booted into Kali. Otherwise, you can get to an EFI shell with ESC, &amp;ldquo;EFI Internal Shell&amp;rdquo;. A &amp;ldquo;happy&amp;rdquo; EFI shell looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image16.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note the fs0 map. Next, you can enter &amp;lsquo;fs0:&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;ls&amp;rsquo; to look around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image17.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can enter &amp;lsquo;cd efi\boot&amp;rsquo; (notice the backslash, not a forward slash!) and boot the device manually with &amp;lsquo;bootx64.efi&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image18.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This should give you a happy EFI boot:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/vmware-fusion-kali-usb-boot/images/image19.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note that on some installations, the shutdown, followed by removing the drive, powering on the VM and inserting the drive might be required. This likely has much to do with the Mac grabbing the USB drive, or half-grabbing it (without mounting).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Drones, Portable CTF Builds, Raspberry Pi Craziness and More!</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-drones-portable-ctf-builds-raspberry-pi-craziness-and-more/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-drones-portable-ctf-builds-raspberry-pi-craziness-and-more/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-drones-portable-ctf-builds-raspberry-pi-craziness-and-more/images/kali-pi-drone.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>The Kali community is a pretty crazy thing. There are folks all over the world doing interesting things with Kali Linux and far too often, these cool projects get overlooked. Part of the problem is that the community is spread out all over the &amp;lsquo;net. We&amp;rsquo;re continuing to help build the Kali community to help with this problem, but that&amp;rsquo;s a slightly longer topic. In the meantime, we want to keep you well-informed about cool stuff that&amp;rsquo;s happening in our world-wide community. We&amp;rsquo;ll also be reaching out to standout members of our community, highlight their work, and get them involved in building our new community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this, the first of many community updates, we want to highlight the work of one of our members, Re4son, who has been a long-time Kali Linux advocate, a volunteer moderator on the &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/">Kali Linux forums&lt;/a> and a &amp;ldquo;Dedicated technology enthusiast, obsessed with setting every machine free from the oppression of its maker&amp;rdquo; who is checking in all the way from Melbourne, Australia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An Offensive Security alumni holding both an &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/">OSCP&lt;/a> and an &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/ctp-osce/">OSCE&lt;/a>, Re4son had an idea to create &amp;ldquo;a small, cheap, autonomous, and low-energy Kali platform with direct hardware access that can do its hacking quietly in the corner or hassle-free on the road&amp;rdquo;. He turned his attention to the Raspberry Pi line, which offered a strong accessory aftermarket, but he discovered that the hardware support was somewhat limited for his needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;In 2015 .. I started porting the drivers myself,&amp;rdquo; he explains, &amp;ldquo;and the sticky fingers (touch screen) interface started off as a way to switch between HDMI and TFT screens without needing a keyboard.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="his-project-has-come-a-long-way">His Project has Come a Long Way&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://whitedome.com.au/re4son/kali-pi/">Sticky Fingers Kali-Pi&lt;/a> combines Kali Linux and the Re4son Kernel into a hassle-free package that turns any Raspberry Pi into a powerful Swiss Army knife with finger-friendly touch screen interface that can provide backend support in your own network, or operate autonomously behind enemy lines, posing as a humidity sensor. Out of the box, the Kali-Pi comes preconfigured with all essential services, such as SSH, VNC, FTP, HTTP, and Wi-Fi backdoor, as well as the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sensepost/mana">MANA toolkit&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.snort.org/">Snort&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.kismetwireless.net/">Kismet&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://metasploit.com/">Metasploit&lt;/a>, etc. and a finger-friendly touch screen interface to control it all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-drones-portable-ctf-builds-raspberry-pi-craziness-and-more/images/01-kali-pi.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Built on a Raspberry Pi 0/0W/1/2/3, this setup can be quick-installed from a pre-configured image or built from scratch, and has options for a TFT touch screen with a custom-built intuitive touch menu, bluetooth, injection support, and more. He&amp;rsquo;s even strapped this puppy onto a drone for some high-flying &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-drones-portable-ctf-builds-raspberry-pi-craziness-and-more/images/02-kali-drone.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the heart of this cool project is the &lt;a href="https://whitedome.com.au/re4son/download/re4son-kernel-current/">Re4son-Kernel&lt;/a> for Raspberry Pi. Built to work with the Pi 0/0W/1/2/3, the Re4son-Kernel, &amp;ldquo;allows Kali Linux to get the best out of any Raspberry Pi by supplying support for the onboard wifi and Bluetooth, wifi injection patches, additional hardware support, security enhancements, headers, sources, etc.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It also provides complete armel support for the Pi 1, Zero, and Zero W and armhf support for the Pi 2 and 3 and all versions are 100% compatible with the stock Kali Linux Kernel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-drones-portable-ctf-builds-raspberry-pi-craziness-and-more/images/03-kali-drone-screen.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, Re4son has released images and instructions for a &amp;ldquo;Damn Vulnerable&amp;rdquo; version of the Sticky Fingers Kali Pi, the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://whitedome.com.au/re4son/sticky-fingers-dv-pi">Sticky Fingers DV-PI&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; which runs on Raspberry Pi 0/0W/1/2/3 (with or without touchscreen) and is pre-configured with &amp;ldquo;easy(ish)&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;medium difficulty&amp;rdquo; vulnerabilities for penetration and privilege escalation. This portable, low cost &amp;ldquo;vulnerability playground&amp;rdquo; is perfect for home research, skills sharpening, training, or even small CTF-style contests wherever you happen to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Offensive Security training courses supply the know-how to achieve world domination&amp;rdquo;, Re4son tells us, &amp;ldquo;and Sticky Fingers Kali-Pi provides the tools. Hacking has never been more fun.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We whole-heartedly agree. We&amp;rsquo;re pretty excited about Re4son&amp;rsquo;s Kali-Pi, Re4son-Kernel, and Sticky Fingers DV-PI projects and are thankful for his unwavering support of users in the &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/">Kali Linux forum&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

We&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce the availability of the &lt;strong>Kali Linux 2017.1 rolling release&lt;/strong>, which brings with it a bunch of exciting updates and features. As with all new releases, you have the common denominator of &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/changelog_page.php">updated packages&lt;/a>, an updated kernel that provides more and better hardware support, as well as a slew of updated tools - but this release has a few more surprises up its sleeve.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="support-for-rtl8812au-wireless-card-injection">Support for RTL8812AU Wireless Card Injection&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A while back, we received a feature request asking for the &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=3260">inclusion of drivers for RTL8812AU wireless chipsets&lt;/a>. These drivers are not part of the standard Linux kernel, and have been modified to allow for injection. Why is this a big deal? This chipset supports &lt;strong>802.11 AC&lt;/strong>, making this one of the first drivers to bring injection-related wireless attacks to this standard, and with companies such as ALFA making the &lt;strong>AWUS036ACH&lt;/strong> wireless cards, we expect this card to be an arsenal favourite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The driver can be installed using the following commands:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2017-1-release/images/AWUS036ACH.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt-get update
apt install realtek-rtl88xxau-dkms
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="streamlined-support-for-cuda-gpu-cracking">Streamlined Support for CUDA GPU Cracking&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Installing proprietary graphics drivers has always been a source of frustration in Kali. Fortunately, improvements in packaging have made this process seamless - allowing our users a streamlined experience with GPU cracking. Together with supported hardware, tools such as Hashcat and Pyrit can take full advantage of NVIDIA GPUs within Kali. For more information about this new feature, check out the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/cloud-cracking-with-cuda-gpu/">related blog post&lt;/a> and updated &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/install-nvidia-drivers-on-kali-linux/">official documentation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2017-1-release/images/small_nvidia-geforce-gtx-1070-5.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="amazon-aws-and-microsoft-azure-availability-gpu-support">Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure Availability (GPU Support)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Due to the increasing popularity of using cloud-based instances for password cracking, we decided to focus our efforts into streamlining Kali&amp;rsquo;s approach. We noticed that Amazon&amp;rsquo;s AWS &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p2/">P2-Series&lt;/a> and Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Azure &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-n-series-general-availability-on-december-1/">NC-Series&lt;/a> allow pass-through GPU support so we made corresponding AWS and Azure images of Kali that support CUDA GPU cracking out of the box. You can check out our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/cloud-cracking-with-cuda-gpu/">Cracking in the Cloud with CUDA GPUs&lt;/a> post we released a few weeks back for more information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2017-1-release/images/Azure-AWS.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="openvas-9-packaged-in-kali-repositories">OpenVAS 9 Packaged in Kali Repositories&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One of the most lacking tool categories in Kali (as well as the Open-source arena at large) is a fully-fledged vulnerability scanner. We&amp;rsquo;ve recently packaged OpenVAS 9 (together with a multitude of dependencies) and can happily say that, in our opinion, the OpenVAS project has matured significantly. We still do not include OpenVAS in the default Kali release due to its large footprint, but OpenVAS can easily be downloaded and installed using the following commands:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2017-1-release/images/openvas9-screenshot.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt-get update
apt install openvas
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>

&lt;p>To those of you following our recent announcement regarding the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/introducing-kali-linux-certified-professional/">Kali Linux Certified Professional&lt;/a> program, we&amp;rsquo;re happy to say that we&amp;rsquo;re spot on schedule. The &lt;em>Kali Linux Revealed&lt;/em> book will be available in early July, and the free online version will be available shortly after that. We&amp;rsquo;re really excited about both the book and the online course and are anxiously waiting for this release - it marks a real cornerstone for us, as our project continues to grow and mature. To keep updated regarding the release of both the book and the online course, make sure to follow us on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kalilinux">Twitter&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This year, we are fortunate enough to debut our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/introducing-kali-linux-certified-professional/">first official Kali Linux training&lt;/a> at the &lt;strong>Black Hat&lt;/strong> conference in Las Vegas, 2017. This in-depth, four day course will focus on the Kali Linux platform itself (as opposed to the tools, or penetration testing techniques), and help you understand and maximize the usage of Kali from the ground up. Delivered by &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/about-us/">Mati Aharoni&lt;/a> and Johnny Long, in this four day class you will learn to become a Kali Linux ninja. We will also be delivering another Dojo event this year - more details about that to come at a later date.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Kali Rolling 2017.1 release can be downloaded via our official Kali Download page. If you missed it, our repositories have recently been &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-repository-https-support/">updated to support HTTPS&lt;/a>, as well as an HTTPS &lt;strong>apt&lt;/strong> transport. This release, we have also updated our &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/">Kali Virtual Images&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/">Kali ARM Images&lt;/a> downloads. As usual, if you&amp;rsquo;ve got Kali already installed, all you need to do to be fully updated is:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt update
apt dist-upgrade
reboot
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We hope you enjoy this fine release!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux Repository HTTPS Support</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-repository-https-support/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-repository-https-support/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-repository-https-support/images/kali-repo-https.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>A couple of weeks back we added more HTTPS support to our Kali infrastructure, and wanted to give our users some guidance and point out what&amp;rsquo;s new. While our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali Linux download page&lt;/a> (and shasums) has always been served via HTTPS, our mirror redirector has not. Now that we generate weekly images, secure access to the mirror redirector has become crucial.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="httpscdimagekaliorg">&lt;a href="https://cdimage.kali.org">https://cdimage.kali.org&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is our Kali Image Mirror Redirector. This server accepts your download requests from our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">official download page&lt;/a>, and then serves your requested file from the geographically closest mirror. This is also the download point for our &lt;a href="https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-weekly/">Kali Weekly builds&lt;/a> - now with fresh and shiny HTTPS support. Hitting this redirector via HTTPS will redirect your request to an SSL enabled download server, while an unencrypted HTTP request will redirect to an HTTP enabled mirror. Where&amp;rsquo;s the catch? Not all donated mirrors support HTTPS, so choosing this transport may result in slower download speeds. Should downloading a Kali image over HTTP be a security concern? Not if you &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/introduction/download-official-kali-linux-images/">GPG verify your downloaded image&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="httpshttpkaliorg">&lt;a href="https://http.kali.org">https://http.kali.org&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As a byproduct of enabling HTTPS on cdimage.kali.org, we now also support &lt;strong>apt&lt;/strong> HTTPS transports. This means that our actual Kali package repositories can support HTTPS - resulting in encrypted Kali updates and upgrades. Surprisingly, this does not add much security to the update / upgrade process (read &lt;a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/146108/how-to-use-https-with-apt-get">here&lt;/a> if you&amp;rsquo;re wondering why) - however it *does* add an extra layer of security, so we figured, &amp;ldquo;why not?&amp;rdquo;. To enable the &lt;strong>apt&lt;/strong> HTTPS transport, first make sure the &lt;strong>apt-transport-https&lt;/strong> package is installed (it&amp;rsquo;s installed by default in our weekly images and upcoming releases) and enable the HTTPS transport in your sources.list file as shown below:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# apt install apt-transport-https
root@kali:~# cat /etc/apt/sources.list
deb https://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib
# deb-src https://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib
root@kali:~#
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now any update or upgrade operation preformed against our mirrors will be HTTPS enabled:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# apt update
Hit:1 https://archive-3.kali.org/kali kali-rolling InRelease
Reading package lists... Done
root@kali:~#
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>As not all donated mirrors come with HTTPS support, shifting to the HTTPS transport may result in a less optimized mirror being selected for you, resulting in slower download speeds. As moving to an apt HTTPS transport &lt;a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/146108/how-to-use-https-with-apt-get">does not provide much extra security&lt;/a>, do so only if you feel you must!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cracking in the Cloud with CUDA GPUs</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/cloud-cracking-with-cuda-gpu/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/cloud-cracking-with-cuda-gpu/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/cloud-cracking-with-cuda-gpu/images/kali-cuda-cracking-cloud.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>Due to increasing popularity of cloud-based instances for password cracking, we decided to focus our efforts into streamlining Kali&amp;rsquo;s approach. We&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that Amazon&amp;rsquo;s AWS &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p2/">P2-Series&lt;/a> and Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Azure &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-n-series-general-availability-on-december-1/">NC-Series&lt;/a> are focused on Windows and Ubuntu. The corresponding blog posts and guides followed suit. Although these instances are limited by the NVIDIA Tesla K80&amp;rsquo;s hardware capabilities, the ability to quickly deploy a Kali instance with CUDA support is appealing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Installing proprietary graphics drivers has always been a source of frustration; fortunately, improvements in packaging have made this process much more seamless. Although we&amp;rsquo;ve done the work for you in the cloud offerings, we&amp;rsquo;d like to help simplify installation for your own use.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>First, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to ensure that your system is fully upgraded and that your card supports &lt;a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus">CUDA&lt;/a>. &lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> GPUs with a &lt;a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus">CUDA compute capability&lt;/a> &amp;gt; 5.0 are recommended, but GPUs with less will still work.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt-get update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt-get dist-upgrade -y
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Once we&amp;rsquo;ve updated the system, we need to check for the &lt;strong>nouveau kernel modules&lt;/strong>, and if enabled, blacklist them.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# lsmod |grep -i nouveau
nouveau 1499136 1
mxm_wmi 16384 1 nouveau
wmi 16384 2 mxm_wmi,nouveau
video 40960 1 nouveau
root@kali:~#
root@kali:~# echo -e &amp;quot;blacklist nouveau\noptions nouveau modeset=0\nalias nouveau off&amp;quot; &amp;gt; /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>After modifying kernel parameters, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to update our &lt;strong>initramfs&lt;/strong>, then reboot.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">update-initramfs -u &amp;amp;&amp;amp; reboot
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="installation-on-a-local-computer">Installation on a Local Computer&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once we have rebooted and have determined that the nouveau modules have not loaded, we will proceed to install the &lt;strong>OpenCL ICD Loader&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>Drivers&lt;/strong>, and the &lt;strong>CUDA toolkit&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt-get install -y ocl-icd-libopencl1 nvidia-driver nvidia-cuda-toolkit
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>During installation of the drivers the system created new kernel modules, so another reboot is required.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="verify-driver-installation">Verify Driver Installation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now that our system should be ready to go, we need to verify the drivers have been loaded correctly. We can quickly verify this by running the &lt;a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-system-management-interface">nvidia-smi&lt;/a> tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# nvidia-smi
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| NVIDIA-SMI 375.26 Driver Version: 375.26 |
|-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

+-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With the output displaying our driver and GPU correctly, we can now dive into password cracking. Before we get too far ahead, let&amp;rsquo;s double check to make sure hashcat and CUDA are working together.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# hashcat -I

&lt;p>After almost two years in the making, it is with great pride that we announce today our new &lt;strong>Kali Linux Professional certification&lt;/strong> - the first and only official certification program that validates one&amp;rsquo;s proficiency with the Kali Linux distribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re new to the information security field, or are looking to take your first steps towards a new career in InfoSec, the KLCP is a &amp;ldquo;must have&amp;rdquo; foundational certification. Built on the philosophy that &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;ve got to walk before you can run,&amp;rdquo; the KLCP will give you direct experience with your working environment and a solid foundation toward a future with any professional InfoSec work. As we continually see, those entering the Offensive Security &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/">PWK&lt;/a> program with previous working experience with Kali, and a general familiarity with Linux, tend to do better in the real world &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/">OSCP&lt;/a> exam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those of you who already have some experience in the field, the KLCP provides a solid and thorough study of the Kali Linux Distribution - learning how to build custom packages, host repositories, manage and orchestrate multiple instances, build custom ISOs, and much, much, more. The KLCP will allow you to take that ambiguous bullet point at the end of your resume - the one that reads &amp;ldquo;Additional Skills - familiarity with Kali Linux&amp;rdquo;, and properly quantify it. &lt;strong>Possession of the KLCP certification means that you have truly mastered the Kali penetration testing distribution and are ready to take your information security skills to the next level&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The KLCP exam will be available via &lt;a href="https://home.pearsonvue.com/">Pearson VUE&lt;/a> exam centres worldwide after the &lt;a href="https://www.blackhat.com/">Black Hat&lt;/a> USA 2017 event in Las Vegas.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>More exciting news! In the past year, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working internally on an Official Kali Linux book - &lt;strong>&lt;em>Kali Linux Revealed: Mastering the Penetration Testing Distribution&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>. This is the first official Kali book from Offsec Press, and is scheduled for release on July 22nd, 2017. &lt;em>Kali Linux Revealed&lt;/em> will be available in both hard copy and online formats. Keeping the Kali Linux spirit, the online version of the book will be free of charge, allowing anyone who wishes to hone their skills and improve their knowledge of Kali to do so at no cost. This book, together with our official Kali documentation site will encompass the body of knowledge for the KLCP.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This year, we are fortunate enough to debut our &lt;a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-17/training/index.html">first official Kali Linux training&lt;/a> at the &lt;strong>Black Hat&lt;/strong> conference in Las Vegas, 2017. This in depth, four day course will focus on the Kali Linux platform itself (as opposed to the tools, or penetration testing techniques), and help you understand and maximize the usage of Kali from the ground up. Delivered by &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/about-us/">Mati Aharoni&lt;/a> and Johnny Long, in this four day class you will learn how to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Gain confidence in basic Linux proficiency, fundamentals, and the command line.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install and verify Kali Linux as a primary OS or virtual machine, including full disk encryption and preseeding.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use Kali as a portable USB distribution including options for encryption, persistence, and &amp;ldquo;self-destruction&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install, remove, customize, and troubleshoot software via the Debian package manager.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thoroughly administer, customize, and configure Kali Linux for a streamlined experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Troubleshoot Kali and diagnose common problems in an optimal way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Secure and monitor Kali at the network and filesystem levels.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create your own packages and host your own custom package repositories.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Roll your own completely customized Kali implementation and preseed your installations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Customize, optimize, and build your own kernel.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Scale and deploy Kali Linux in the enterprise.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manage and orchestrate multiple installations of Kali Linux.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Please Note: This is not a penetration testing course.&lt;/strong> This course is focused on teaching the student how to get the most out of the Kali Linux Penetration Testing Platform, not how to use the packaged tools in an offensive manner. Attending students will receive a signed copy of the &amp;ldquo;Kali Linux Revealed&amp;rdquo; book as well as a free voucher to sit the KLCP exam in a nearby &lt;a href="https://home.pearsonvue.com/">Pearson VUE&lt;/a> certification centre.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot has been going on behind the scenes in the Kali Linux arena, and we&amp;rsquo;re excited to see our distribution get a free and formal education path. We believe this will improve the skills of those using Kali Linux and better the community and information security industry as a whole. We are putting all our efforts into finishing up the Kali Revealed book, and will keep y&amp;rsquo;all updated as the release date nears. In the meantime, follow us on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kalilinux">twitter&lt;/a> to get realtime updates as they come out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux in the AWS cloud, again</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-aws-cloud/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-aws-cloud/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-aws-cloud/images/kali-amazon-aws-2.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce that we&amp;rsquo;ve once again listed our &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08LL91KKB">Kali Linux images on the Amazon AWS&lt;/a> marketplace. You can now spin up an updated Kali machine easily through your EC2 panel. Our current image is a &amp;ldquo;full&amp;rdquo; image, which contains all the standard tools available in a full Kali release. Once your instance is running, connect to it with your SSH private key using the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>ec2-user&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; account. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to update your Kali instance to get the latest packages and bug fixes. Type as root (or sudo): &lt;strong>apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt dist-upgrade&lt;/strong>. We are &amp;ldquo;selling&amp;rdquo; these images on the marketplace for &lt;strong>free&lt;/strong>, so other than the regular Amazon charges, there are no extras to pay. The Kali team would like to take this opportunity to thank &lt;strong>r0kh&lt;/strong> for his efforts of getting Kali back on track (no pun intended) and working flawlessly in AWS. If you plan to use these Kali images for penetration testing in an AWS environment, make sure you check out the Amazon penetration testing &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/">request form&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Over the past couple of weeks we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on building and implementing Kali 2016.2 in the &lt;strong>Azure Marketplace&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce that from today on, you can &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/kali-linux/kali-linux/">spin up a Kali machine&lt;/a> from the Azure Marketplace. In just a few seconds, you can have a full &lt;strong>penetration testing toolset&lt;/strong> at your fingertips for no additional cost (other than the standard Azure pricing). If you are a new Azure customer, you can create a free account and receive &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0044p/">$200 credit&lt;/a>.

&lt;h2 id="kali-linux-weekly-iso-builds">Kali Linux Weekly ISO Builds&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As we mentioned in our Kali Rolling 2016.2 release, we&amp;rsquo;ve started building weekly images of our Kali ISOs. This allows people access to &amp;ldquo;fresher&amp;rdquo; and more up-to-date Kali builds at any given time, and helps cut back on the long waits for updates. The ISOs will be generated each &lt;strong>Sunday&lt;/strong> and will be versioned as &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>-W&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;. Once all builds are generated, they will be available via &lt;a href="http://cdimage.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/">cdimage.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly&lt;/a>. Each weekly release will have it&amp;rsquo;s own SHA1SUM file which will be available at &lt;a href="https://archive.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/SHA1SUMS">archive.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/SHA1SUMS&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We are overjoyed with the &lt;strong>positive feedback&lt;/strong> we have received from the 2016.2 update and our download servers have been squealing, serving well over 290,000 copies of Kali this month. We very much appreciate the kind words and as always, would recommend that if you happen to come across any problems - make sure to report them to us through our &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">bug tracker&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, we have had the pleasure of watching Kali make an appearance on &lt;a href="https://www.usanetwork.com/mr-robot">Mr Robot&lt;/a> multiple times! We have always been impressed with how grounded the technology is on that show, and seeing Kali leveraged in realistic manners is always fun. Finally, we wanted to make one last shout out about the upcoming Kali Dojo at &lt;a href="https://ekoparty.org/kali-workshops.php">ekoparty&lt;/a>. If you are attending, be sure to drop in and say hello!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux 2016.2 Release</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2016-2-release/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2016-2-release/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2016-2-release/images/kali-rolling-2016-2-release3.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re well recovered from the Black Hat and DEF CON Vegas conferences and as promised, we&amp;rsquo;re launching our second Kali Rolling ISO release aka &lt;strong>Kali 2016.2&lt;/strong>. This release brings a whole bunch of interesting news and updates into the world of Kali and we&amp;rsquo;re &lt;strong>excited&lt;/strong> to tell you all about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-kde-mate-lxde-e17-and-xfce-builds">New KDE, MATE, LXDE, e17, and Xfce Builds&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Although users are able to build and customize their Kali Linux ISOs however they wish, we often hear people comment about how they would love to see Kali with $desktop_environment instead of GNOME. We then engage with those people passionately, about how they can use live-build to customize not only their desktop environment but pretty much &lt;strong>every aspect of their ISO&lt;/strong>, together with the ability to run scripted hooks at every stage of the ISO creation process - but more often than not, our argument is quickly lost in random conversation. As such, we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to expand our &amp;ldquo;full&amp;rdquo; 64bit releases with additional Desktop Environment flavored ISOs, specifically &lt;strong>KDE, Mate, LXDE and Enlightenment&lt;/strong>. These can now be downloaded via our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali Download page&lt;/a>. For those curious to see what the various Desktop Environments look like, we&amp;rsquo;ve taken some screenshots for you:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="kali-linux-weekly-isos">Kali Linux Weekly ISOs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Constantly keeping Kali on the bleeding edge means frequent updates to packages on an ongoing basis. Since our last release several months ago, there&amp;rsquo;s a few hundred new or updated packages which have been pushed to the Kali repos. This means that anyone downloading an ISO even 3 months old has somewhat of a long &amp;ldquo;apt-get dist-upgrade&amp;rdquo; ahead of them. To help avoid this situation, from this release onwards, we&amp;rsquo;ll be publishing updated weekly builds of Kali that will be available to download via our mirrors. Speaking of mirrors, we are always in need of support in this area - &lt;strong>if you&amp;rsquo;re capable of running a high-bandwidth mirror and would like to support our project, please check out our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/community/kali-linux-mirrors/">Kali Mirrors&lt;/a> page&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bug-fixes-and-os-improvements">Bug Fixes and OS Improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>During these past few months, we&amp;rsquo;ve been busy adding new relevant tools to Kali as well as fixing various bugs and implementing OS enhancements. For example, something as simple as adding HTTPS support in &lt;strong>busybox&lt;/strong> now allows us to preseed Kali installations securely over SSL. This is a quick and cool feature to speed up your installations and make them (almost) unattended, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a custom built ISO.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We are really excited about these changes to Kali as we continue to improve and expand the best Linux-based penetration testing framework around. Beyond these distribution changes, there have been a number of other project-related events such as the multitude of times that Kali has been &lt;a href="https://sendvid.com/s0etudtt">featured&lt;/a> on the hit USA network series &lt;a href="https://www.usanetwork.com/mr-robot">Mr Robot&lt;/a> and the Official &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kalilinux">Kali Linux Twitter&lt;/a> account becoming a verified account.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We have really enjoyed doing the &lt;a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/kali-linux.html">&lt;strong>Dojo at Black Hat&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> the last few years. It&amp;rsquo;s been a great opportunity to show off some of the lesser known (but oh so useful) &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/features/">features of Kali Linux&lt;/a> as well as interact with the user base. But one of the limitations of the previous structure was that while this was a hands-on exercise, many attendees moved at different paces from each other. So we wanted to move towards more of a &amp;ldquo;self service&amp;rdquo; model where &lt;strong>attendees can drop in, have access to the training material, and will be free to work at their own pace&lt;/strong>. We accomplished with the new model we will be premiering this year, allowing everyone to take as much, or as little, time needed to get a working Kali install customized to their desires. While this is being done, &lt;strong>Kali developers will be onsite and interacting with everyone&lt;/strong> on a consistent basis.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hacking-the-playground-with-kali-linux">Hacking the playground with Kali Linux&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This leads to the next major change in structure, as in previous years a commonly heard question was &amp;ldquo;Great! I have this beautiful Kali install, now what do I do with it?&amp;rdquo;. This year, we have a great answer for this: &lt;strong>Hack our systems&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our good friends at &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/">Offensive Security&lt;/a> have been gracious enough to provide us with a number of systems that have been preconfigured with interesting and unique vulnerabilities. This environment will will be setup in the room, and attendees can connect into it and put Kali Linux to use, hacking these systems to your hearts content. Whats more, we will be providing some extra incentive for you to &lt;strong>hack all the things&lt;/strong>, by giving away &lt;strong>prizes&lt;/strong> to those that obtain the highest score.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Powerful 64bit laptop with Kali Rolling (!) installed in a VM or natively.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At least 40 GB free space in the VM or laptop for generating ISOs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>8GB USB 3.0 stick (or larger) for creating Kali Live USBs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We will have Kali VMWare images for you to download on site - so if you choose this option, make sure you have the latest VMware Workstation of Fusion installed. Yes, make sure it&amp;rsquo;s the LATEST version!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="come-say-hello">Come say hello!&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Today marks an important milestone for us with the first public release of our &lt;strong>Kali Linux rolling distribution&lt;/strong>. Kali switched to a rolling release model back when we hit &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2-0-release/">version 2.0&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> (codename), however the rolling release was only available via an upgrade from 2.0 to kali-rolling for a select brave group. After 5 months of testing our rolling distribution (and its supporting infrastructure), we&amp;rsquo;re confident in its reliability - giving our users the best of all worlds - the stability of Debian, together with the latest versions of the many outstanding &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/">penetration testing tools&lt;/a> created and shared by the information security community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2016-1-release/images/kali-rolling-screenshot.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-new-in-kali-rolling">What&amp;rsquo;s new in Kali Rolling?&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="kali-rolling-release-vs-standard-releases">Kali Rolling Release vs Standard Releases&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To get a better understanding of the changes that this brings to Kali, a clearer picture of &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/rolling-release-vs-fixed-release-linux/">how rolling releases work&lt;/a> is needed. Rather than Kali basing itself off standard Debian releases (such as Debian 7, 8, 9) and going through the cyclic phases of &amp;ldquo;new, mainstream, outdated&amp;rdquo;, the Kali rolling release feeds continuously from &lt;a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/testing">Debian testing&lt;/a>, &lt;strong>ensuring a constant flow of the latest package versions&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="continuously-updated-penetration-testing-tools">Continuously Updated Penetration Testing Tools&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Our automated notification system of updated penetration testing tool releases has been working well over the past 5 months and has ensured that the kali-rolling repository always holds the latest stable releases of monitored tools. This usually leaves a gap of around 24-48 hours from notification of a new tool update, to its packaging, testing, and pushing into our repositories. We would also like to introduce our new &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://pkg.kali.org/">Kali Linux Package Tracker&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> which allows you to &lt;strong>follow the evolution of Kali Linux both with email updates and a comprehensive web interface&lt;/strong>. The tracker can also help in identifying which versions of various tools and packages are in our repository at any given moment. As an example, the screenshot below shows the timeline of the &lt;strong>nmap&lt;/strong> package in Kali and tracks its repository versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2016-1-release/images/pkg-kali.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="vmware-tools-vs-open-vm-tools">VMware Tools vs Open-VM-Tools&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This release also marks a dramatic change around how VMware guest tools are installed. As of Sept 2015, VMware &lt;a href="https://kb.vmware.com/kb/2073803">recommends&lt;/a> using the distribution-specific &lt;strong>open-vm-tools&lt;/strong> instead of the VMware Tools package for guest machines. We have made sure that our package installs and works correctly with the latest Kali rolling kernel and are happy to see that all the needed functionality such as file copying, clipboard copy/paste and automatic screen resizing are working perfectly. To install open-vm-tools in your Kali Rolling image, enter:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt-get update
apt-get install open-vm-tools-desktop fuse
reboot
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="transitioning-from-kali-20-to-kali-rolling">Transitioning From Kali 2.0 to Kali Rolling&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Migrating from Kali sana (2.0) to Kali rolling is simple. As root, you can run the following commands and be on your way:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">cat &amp;lt; /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib
EOF
apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade
# get a coffee, or 10.
reboot

&lt;p>Our on-going mission to give all our Kali sites a facelift and common look and feel has made its way to the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/">Kali Tools&lt;/a> website. Beyond its clean good looks, the Kali tools site includes descriptions and sample usage for virtually every tool in the Kali Linux arsenal. You can quickly select tools by what they do, such as conducting &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/kali-meta/#kali-tools-information-gathering">information gathering&lt;/a>, cracking &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/kali-meta/#kali-tools-passwords">passwords&lt;/a>, doing &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/kali-meta/#kali-tools-information-gathering">DNS&lt;/a> enumeration, evaluating &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/kali-meta/#kali-tools-wireless">wireless&lt;/a> networks, and much, much more. In addition, we have started adding community driven videos to some of the tool entries, currently taken from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/10101_Brew">@10101_Brew&lt;/a>. Keep them coming!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Kali Linux 2.0 has been out for a couple of months and the response has been great, with well &lt;strong>over a million unique downloads of Kali 2.0&lt;/strong> as a testament. Release day was somewhat hectic for us, as we did not anticipate the sheer volume of traffic â¦ which we somehow always underestimate. In the first few days after the release of 2.0, we had &lt;strong>ten times&lt;/strong> the download volume of 1.0 in a similar period, back in 2013.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-moto-repository-purge">Kali Moto Repository Purge&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve given Kali Moto (1.0) a good two months of grace time and will be purging the unsupported 1.0 distribution files from our repositories in the next few days. If you&amp;rsquo;re still using Kali 1.0 then it&amp;rsquo;s definitely time to either upgrade or update.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">cat &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF &amp;gt; /etc/apt/sources.list

EOF
apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade # get a coffee, or 10.
reboot
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If for some reason you can&amp;rsquo;t upgrade, we&amp;rsquo;ve set aside an archive mirror of Kali 1.0, which can be set as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">cat &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF &amp;gt; /etc/apt/sources.list

&lt;p>It occurred to us that after the BlackHat and DEF CON conferences, we never made a public announcement regarding the availability of our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/dojo-mastering-live-build/">Kali Linux Dojo 2015 slides&lt;/a> and notes. The Dojo was &lt;strong>great fun&lt;/strong> - we definitely enjoyed showing our brand spanking new Kali 2.0 to the the crowds, who built their own Kali 2.0 ISOs a day before release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-moto-eol/images/dojo-slide-e1444909261539.png" alt="">&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux 2.0 Release - Sana</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2-0-release/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2-0-release/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2-0-release/images/kali-linux-2-0-release.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;h2 id="our-next-generation-penetration-testing-platform">Our Next Generation Penetration Testing Platform&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re still buzzing and recovering from the Black Hat and DEF CON conferences where we finished presenting our new [Kali Linux Dojo](](/docs/development/dojo-mastering-live-build/), which was a blast. With the help of &lt;strong>a few good people&lt;/strong>, the Dojo rooms were set up ready for the masses - where many &lt;strong>generated their very own Kali 2.0 ISOs for the first time&lt;/strong>. But the excitement doesn&amp;rsquo;t end for us just yet. With the end of the cons, we now find ourselves smack in the middle of &lt;strong>the most significant release of Kali since 2013&lt;/strong>. Today is the day that Kali 2.0 is officially released.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>So, what&amp;rsquo;s new in Kali 2.0?&lt;/strong> There&amp;rsquo;s a new 4.0 kernel, now based on Debian Jessie, improved hardware and wireless driver coverage, support for a variety of Desktop Environments (gnome, kde, xfce, mate, e17, lxde, i3wm), updated desktop environment and tools - and the list goes on. But these bulletpoint items are essentially a &lt;strong>side effect of the real changes that have taken place&lt;/strong> in our development backend. Ready to hear the real news? &lt;strong>Take a deep breath, it&amp;rsquo;s a long list&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2-0-release/images/tools-slider.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-linux-is-now-a-rolling-distribution">Kali Linux is Now a Rolling Distribution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the biggest moves we&amp;rsquo;ve taken to keep Kali 2.0 &lt;strong>up-to-date in a global, continuous manner,&lt;/strong> is transforming Kali into a &lt;strong>rolling distribution.&lt;/strong> What this means is that we are pulling our packages continuously from &lt;a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/testing">Debian Testing&lt;/a> (after making sure that all packages are installable) - essentially upgrading the Kali core system, while allowing us to take advantage of newer Debian packages as they roll out. This move is where our choice in Debian as a base system really pays off - we get to enjoy the stability of Debian, while still remaining &lt;em>on the cutting edge&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="continuously-updated-tools-enhanced-workflow">Continuously Updated Tools, Enhanced Workflow&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Another interesting development in our infrastructure has been the integration of an &lt;strong>upstream version checking system&lt;/strong>, which alerts us when new upstream versions of tools are released (usually via git tagging). This script runs daily on a select list of common tools and keeps us alerted if a new tool requires updating. With this new system in place, &lt;strong>core tool updates will happen more frequently&lt;/strong>. With the introduction of this new monitoring system, we will slowly start phasing out the &amp;ldquo;tool upgrades&amp;rdquo; option in our &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">bug tracker&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-flavours-of-kali-linux-20">New Flavours of Kali Linux 2.0&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Through our Live Build process, Kali 2.0 now natively supports &lt;strong>KDE, GNOME3, Xfce, MATE, e17, lxde and i3wm&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;ve moved on to &lt;a href="https://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/">GNOME 3&lt;/a> in this release, marking the end of a long abstinence period. We&amp;rsquo;ve finally embraced GNOME 3 and with a few custom changes, it&amp;rsquo;s grown to be our favourite desktop environment. We&amp;rsquo;ve added custom support for multi-level menus, true terminal transparency, as well as a handful of useful gnome shell extensions. This however has come at a price - &lt;strong>the minimum RAM requirements for a full GNOME 3 session has increased to 768 MB&lt;/strong>. This is a non-issue on modern hardware but can be detrimental on lower-end machines. For this reason, we have also released an official, &lt;strong>minimal Kali 2.0 ISO&lt;/strong>. This &amp;ldquo;light&amp;rdquo; flavour of Kali includes a handful of useful tools together with the lightweight &lt;a href="https://www.xfce.org/">Xfce&lt;/a> desktop environment - a perfect solution for resource-constrained computers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kali-linux-20-arm-images--nethunter-20">Kali Linux 2.0 ARM Images &amp;amp; NetHunter 2.0&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The whole &lt;strong>ARM&lt;/strong> image section has been updated across the board with Kali 2.0 - including Raspberry Pi, Chromebooks, Odroids&amp;hellip; The whole lot! In the process, we&amp;rsquo;ve added some new images - such as the latest &lt;strong>Chromebook Flip&lt;/strong> - the little beauty here on the right. Go ahead, click on the image, take a closer look. Another helpful change we&amp;rsquo;ve implemented in our ARM images is including kernel sources, for easier compilation of new drivers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We haven&amp;rsquo;t forgotten about &lt;strong>NetHunter&lt;/strong>, our favourite mobile penetration testing platform - which also got an update and now includes Kali 2.0. With this, we&amp;rsquo;ve released a whole barrage of new NetHunter images for Nexus 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10. The &lt;strong>OnePlus One&lt;/strong> NetHunter image has also been updated to Kali 2.0 and now has a much awaited &lt;strong>image for CM12 as well&lt;/strong> - check the &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-nethunter-download/">Offensive Security NetHunter&lt;/a> page for more information.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="tldr-wheres-my-kali-20-download">TL;DR. Where&amp;rsquo;s My Kali 2.0 Download?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The tl;dr of this release is best explained by comparison: If Kali 1.0 was &lt;strong>focused on building a solid infrastructure&lt;/strong> then Kali 2.0 is &lt;strong>focused on overhauling the user experience and maintaining updated packages and tool repositories&lt;/strong>. Along with the arrival of 2.0 comes a whole lot of interesting updates&amp;hellip; You can head down to our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali Linux 2.0 Download&lt;/a> page to get the goodness for yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="still-tl-still-dr-how-do-i-upgrade-to-kali-20">Still TL; Still DR. How Do I Upgrade to Kali 2.0?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Yes, you &lt;strong>&lt;em>can&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> upgrade Kali 1.x to Kali 2.0! To do this, you will need to edit your source.list entries, and run a &lt;strong>dist-upgrade&lt;/strong> as shown below. If you have been using incorrect or extraneous Kali repositories or otherwise manually installed or overwritten Kali packages outside of &lt;strong>apt&lt;/strong>, your upgrade to Kali 2.0 may fail. This includes scripts like lazykali.sh, PTF, manual git clones in incorrect directories, etc. - All of these will clobber existing files on the filesystem and result in a failed upgrade. If this is the case for you, you&amp;rsquo;re better off reinstalling your OS from scratch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Otherwise, feel free to:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="metasploit-community--pro-no-longer-ships-in-kali">Metasploit Community / Pro no longer ships in Kali&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the request of Rapid7, we have &lt;strong>removed the Metasploit Community / Pro package&lt;/strong> from Kali Linux and now host the Open-source &lt;strong>&lt;em>metasploit-framework&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> package only. For all of you who require Community or Pro, you will now need to &lt;strong>download it from Rapid7&lt;/strong> and then register and submit your personal details in order to get a license. In addition, &lt;em>the Rapid7 team no longer maintains the Metasploit package in Kali&lt;/em>, which has brought with it some substantial changes - we&amp;rsquo;ve moved to a &amp;ldquo;native&amp;rdquo; setup, where rather than bundling all the required software needed to run Metasploit in one big package, we use native dependencies within Kali to support the &lt;strong>&lt;em>metasploit-framework&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> package. This results in a &lt;strong>faster, smoother work experience and easier integration&lt;/strong> with Metasploit dependencies. For more information about this, check out our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/tools/starting-metasploit-framework-in-kali/">Metasploit Framework in Kali&lt;/a> documentation page.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="starting-up-metasploit-framework-in-kali-linux-20">Starting up Metasploit Framework in Kali Linux 2.0&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Due to the above-mentioned changes in the &lt;strong>&lt;em>metasploit-framework&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> package, there are some minor changes in how Metasploit is started in Kali - specifically, there &lt;strong>is no longer a &lt;em>metasploit&lt;/em> service&lt;/strong>. This is how you start up the Metasploit Framework with database support in Kali Linux 2.0:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh"># Start the Postgresql Database
/etc/init.d/postgresql start
# Initialize the Metasploit Framework Database
msfdb init
# Run msfconsole
msfconsole
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>

&lt;p>Last week we received an email from a fellow penetration tester, requesting official &lt;a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/kalilinux/kali-rolling/">&lt;strong>Kali Linux Docker images&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> that he could use for his work. We bootstrapped a minimal Kali Linux 1.1.0a base and registered it under our Kali Linux Docker account. A few minutes later, said fellow pentester was up and running with Metasploit and the Top 10 Kali Linux tools on his Macbook Pro.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="docker-is-awesome">Docker is Awesome&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The more we started looking into Docker and all of its features, the more we realized the endless possibilities of this technology - from helping us in our own internal Kali beta testing, to furthering the reach of Kali to foreign distributions and esoteric operating systems. The fact that you can run Docker on pretty much every operating system under the sun makes this feature extra sexy. The beauty in this process is that Kali is placed in a nice, neat container without polluting your guest filesystem. With this in place, you have full access to all the Kali packages on any and all systems that run Docker - which ends up being quite an expansive list.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Obviously, to get this running, you need to &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/installation/">install&lt;/a> Docker. For &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/">Docker on OSX&lt;/a> you can use brew, while for most other distributions, you can install it using your local package manager. Once installed and set up, it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of pulling our image from the Docker repository:&lt;/p>

These new additions and updates are fairly significant, and may even change your wireless attack workflows. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short run-down of the updates and the changes they bring.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pixiewps---bruteforce-wps-pins-in-seconds">Pixiewps - Bruteforce WPS pins in seconds&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/wiire-a/pixiewps">Pixiewps&lt;/a> is a tool used for offline brute forcing of WPS pins, while exploiting the low or non-existing entropy of some &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tSlbqVQ59kGn8hgmwcPTHUECQ3o9YhXR91A_p7Nnj5Y/edit?usp=sharing">wireless access points&lt;/a> also known as the &lt;strong>pixie dust attack&lt;/strong>, discovered by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Reversity/status/490978005859454978">Dominique Bongard&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="http://archive.hack.lu/2014/Hacklu2014_offline_bruteforce_attack_on_wps.pdf">slides&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://video.adm.ntnu.no/pres/549931214e18d">video&lt;/a>). The pixiewps tool (developed by &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/member.php?30454-wiire">wiire&lt;/a>), was born out of the Kali forums, and the development of the tool can be tracked throughout an interesting &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php?24286-WPS-Pixie-Dust-Attack-(Offline-WPS-Attack)">forum post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the correct environment, pixiewps dramatically speeds up the WPS brute force attack time from what was taking up to 12 hours to a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f6oClT7Wp4">a few seconds&lt;/a>. This new attack is mind numbing, and we are somewhat surprised that it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been discussed on a wider basis. Watch our following video closely, and see how we &lt;strong>extract the WPA shared key of this EdiMAX wireless access point in a few seconds&lt;/strong> using updated versions of pixiewps and reaver, already packaged in Kali:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="aircrack-ng-v12-rc2-update">Aircrack-ng v1.2 RC2 Update&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/aircrack-ng/">Aircrack-ng&lt;/a> is the de facto penetration tool suite - essential for any wireless penetration tests or assessments. In this latest Aircrack-ng release, amongst the normal bug fixes and code improvements there has been a significant change to &lt;strong>airmon-ng&lt;/strong>, the tool used to put wireless cards into &lt;em>monitor mode&lt;/em>. Other new and notable features are that &lt;strong>airtun-ng&lt;/strong> is now able to decrypt WPA as well as several new &lt;strong>airodump-ng&lt;/strong> flags, such as &lt;em>- -wps&lt;/em> and &lt;em>- -uptime.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/pixiewps-reaver-aircrack-ng-updates/images/airmon-ng-1.2rc2-kali-linux1.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also notice the new naming convention of the wireless virtual interfaces - &lt;strong>wlanXmon&lt;/strong>, as opposed to &lt;strong>monX&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="goodbye-mon0-hello-wlan0mon">Goodbye mon0, hello wlan0mon!&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For the latest few releases, the &lt;em>aircrack-ng&lt;/em> suite had bundled with it &lt;strong>airmon-zc,&lt;/strong> which uses an improved method of placing wireless cards into monitor mode, as well as more verbose output options. With the release of Aircrack-ng 1.2 RC2, &lt;strong>airmon-zc&lt;/strong> has officially replaced the original &lt;strong>aircrack-ng&lt;/strong>, as the new standard.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="more-verbose-airmon-ng-output">More verbose airmon-ng output&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When things are going right, everything is great! However when this isn&amp;rsquo;t the case, and you need to &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-wireless-driver-issues/">troubleshoot wireless issues&lt;/a>, you can now use a single command &lt;strong>airmon-ng &amp;ndash;verbose start wlan0&lt;/strong> to gather all the relent information needed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/reaver/">reaver&lt;/a> project was originally developed by Craig Heffner, and the last release was 1.4. As the project seems to have been abandoned, several forks have cropped up - one belonging to a member of the Kali forums, &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/member.php?31103-t6_x">t6_x&lt;/a>, who has also integrated the pixiewps attack into a newly minted 1.5.2 release. &lt;a href="https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x">This new&lt;/a> version implements an array of improvements on the original version, and will hopefully be activity maintained by the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-kali-community-rocks">The Kali Community Rocks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the advantages of being a Kali forum moderator is that you get to witness the community grow and interact. Since the original &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php?24286-WPS-Pixie-Dust-Attack-(Offline-WPS-Attack)">pixiewps thread&lt;/a> started by &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/member.php?17496-soxrok2212">soxrok2212&lt;/a>, it has received over 300 responses, bringing about the implementation of new ideas and updates to the tool. Watching this project emerge from a single forum post all the way to the release of the tool, and seeing the co-operation between the various tool developers while working to get interoperability between their tools was a real privilege.&lt;/p>

For this reason, we&amp;rsquo;ve manually packaged the latest and newly released &lt;a href="https://www.openvas.org/">OpenVAS&lt;/a> 8.0 tool and libraries for Kali Linux. Although nothing major has changed in this release in terms of running the vulnerability scanner, we wanted to give a quick overview on how to get it up and running.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-kali-for-vulnerability-scanning">Setting up Kali for Vulnerability Scanning&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, make sure your Kali is up-to-date and install the latest OpenVAS. Once done, run the &lt;strong>openvas-setup&lt;/strong> command to setup OpenVAS, download the latest rules, create an admin user, and start up the various services. Depending on your bandwidth and computer resources, this could take a while.&lt;/p>

This release brings with it a mix of unprecedented hardware support as well as rock solid stability. For us, this is a real milestone as this release epitomizes the benefits of our move from &lt;a href="https://www.backtrack-linux.org/">BackTrack&lt;/a> to Kali Linux over two years ago. As we look at a now mature Kali, we see a versatile, flexible Linux distribution, rich with useful security and &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/features/">penetration testing related features&lt;/a>, running on all sorts of weird and wonderful &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm">ARM hardware&lt;/a>. But enough talk, here are the goods:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The new release runs a 3.18 kernel, patched for wireless injection attacks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our ISO build systems are now running off live-build 4.x.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improved wireless driver support, due to both kernel and firmware upgrades.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>NVIDIA Optimus hardware support.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Updated virtualbox-tool, openvm-tools and &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-vmware-guest-tools/">vmware-tools packages and instructions&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A whole bunch of fixes and updates from our bug-tracker &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/changelog_page.php">changelog&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And most importantly, we changed grub screens and wallpapers!&lt;/li>

&lt;p>page in the next few days. As usual, if you&amp;rsquo;ve already got Kali Linux installed and running, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to re-download the image as you can simply update your existing operating system using simple &lt;strong>apt&lt;/strong> commands:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt-get update

&lt;p>Over the past couple of weeks, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen a bunch of nasty bugs hit the scene, from &lt;strong>shellshock&lt;/strong> to Debian &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.debian.org/security/2014/dsa-3025">apt&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> vulnerabilities. As we prefer not to ship vulnerable ISOs, we&amp;rsquo;ve rolled up new images for our Kali Linux and NetHunter releases as well our Amazon AWS images with the relevant security fixes in place. These images correspond to Kali 1.0.9a and &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/offsec/kali-nexus-nethunter-1-0-2/">NetHunter 1.0.2&lt;/a> versions, now available for &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">download&lt;/a> through our mirrors. We expect the Amazon images to be updated in the AWS backend by the end of the week. If you&amp;rsquo;re already running Kali Linux, all you need to do is run an update and dist-upgrade to get the latest and greatest:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/kali-nethunter/">Offensive Security NetHunter&lt;/a> release was a success and has brought about a huge amount of interest in our Nexus ROM overlay. We are happy and thankful to see a NetHunter community spring up and &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/community/contribute/">contribute&lt;/a> to the project so actively. Since the release, we have been repeatedly asked about our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/policy/EULA.txt">Kali EULA&lt;/a> and whether NetHunter can be used for &lt;strong>commercial purposes&lt;/strong> such as professional penetration testing or running security assessments. &lt;strong>The answer is a resounding YES&lt;/strong>, currently making NetHunter the only free Nexus Android system which is Open-source and allowed for commercial use. If you&amp;rsquo;re doing any serious work with NetHunter, make sure it is &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php?23022-Securing-your-NetHunter-Device">properly secured&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php?22901-NetHunter-Disk-Encryption">encrypted&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h5 id="odroid-u3-cubox-i-arm-images-added">Odroid U3, Cubox-i ARM Images Added&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>We have also included two more images to our Kali ARM image collection for the Odroid U3 and Cubox-i ARM computers. Each of these have interesting use cases as both their small form factor and specs are formidable. All of these news scripts can be found in our &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm">Offensive Security Github&lt;/a> page.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="new-kali-tools-website">New Kali Tools Website!&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>After many months of typing, editing, and testing, we are delighted to announce the launch of our new &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools">Kali Linux Tools&lt;/a> website. This new site is our official home for information on all of the tools included in Kali Linux. For each tool, you will find a description of the tool, links to the tool homepage, author and license information, and usage output so you can see what output you can expect from each utility in Kali.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to the primary listing of all &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/">Kali tools&lt;/a>, we have also made an effort to use tags throughout the site so you can more easily find a particular tool based on what it can do. You will find a tag cloud at the bottom of each page as you navigate the site. Also available is a full breakdown of the contents of each &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/">Kali Linux metapackage&lt;/a>, allowing you to see which tool is included in a particular metapackage, which makes the building of &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/live-build-a-custom-kali-iso/">custom ISOs&lt;/a> much easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope you enjoy our new Kali Linux Tools site and find it as useful as we do.

This new feature simplifies getting Kali installed and running on more recent hardware which requires EFI as well as various Apple Macbooks Air and Retina models. Besides the addition of EFI support, there is a whole array of &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/changelog_page.php">tool updates and fixes&lt;/a> that have accumulated over the past couple of months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As this new release focuses almost entirely on the EFI capable ISO image, Offensive Security won&amp;rsquo;t be releasing additional ARM or VMWare images with 1.0.8. As usual, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to re-download Kali if you&amp;rsquo;ve got it installed, and apt-get update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt-get dist-upgrade should do the job.&lt;/p>

If you&amp;rsquo;re attending these conferences, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to join our one day, free [Kali Linux Dojo workshop](](/docs/development/dojo-mastering-live-build/), where we will be teaching and demonstrating the awesome stuff you can do with the Kali Linux Distribution. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be intensive and hands on, so you&amp;rsquo;ll need to &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux/kali-linux-workshop/">bring some stuff with you&lt;/a> if you attend. &lt;strong>We expect this to be one of our most engaging and interesting events ever!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="kali-linux-a-penetration-testing-platform">Kali Linux, a Penetration Testing Platform&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>While keeping an up-to-date toolset is most definitely an important part of any security distribution, much of our resources are also spent on building, testing and fixing &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/">useful features&lt;/a> for individuals in the Security and Forensics fields. Building on our ever-growing list of such features, we can now happily say that &lt;strong>the Kali image is a EFI Bootable ISO Hybrid image that supports Live USB Encrypted Persistence with LUKS Nuke support&lt;/strong>, out of the box. Yippie!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux 1.0.7 Release</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-7-release/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-7-release/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-7-release/images/kali-1.0.7-release.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;h4 id="kernel-314-tool-updates-package-improvements">Kernel 3.14, Tool Updates, Package Improvements&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Kali linux 1.0.7 has just been released, complete with a whole bunch of tool updates, a new kernel, and some cool new features. Check out our &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/changelog_page.php">changelog&lt;/a> for a full list of these items. As usual, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to re-download or re-install Kali to benefit from these updates - you can update to the latest and greatest using these simple commands:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade
# If you've just updated your kernel, then: reboot
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h4 id="kali-linux-encrypted-usb-persistence">Kali Linux Encrypted USB Persistence&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>One of the new sought out features introduced (which is also partially responsible for the kernel update) is the ability to create &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux/kali-encrypted-usb-persistence/">Kali Linux Live USB with LUKS Encrypted Persistence&lt;/a>. This feature ushers in a new era of secure Kali Linux USB portability, allowing us to either boot to a &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; Kali image or alternatively, overlay it with the contents of a persistent encrypted partition, all within the same USB drive.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="tool-developers-ahoy">Tool Developers Ahoy!&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This release also marks the beginning of some co-ordinated efforts between Kali developers and tool developers to make sure their tools are represented correctly and are fully functional within Kali Linux. We would like to thank the metasploit, w3af, and wpscan dev teams for working with us to perfect their Kali packages and hope that more tool developers join in. Tool developers are welcome to send us an email to:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-7-release/images/info-email-fix.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and we&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to work with you to better integrate your tool into Kali.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="kali-linux-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts">Kali Linux: Greater Than the Sum of its Parts&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>For quite some time now, we&amp;rsquo;ve been preaching that Kali Linux is more than a &amp;ldquo;Linux distribution with a collection of tools in it&amp;rdquo;. We invest a significant amount of time and resources developing and enabling features in the distribution which we think are useful for penetration testers and other security professionals. These features range from things like &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>live-build&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;, which allows our end users to easily customize their own Kali ISOs, to features like &lt;strong>Live USB persistence encryption&lt;/strong>, which provides paranoid users with an extra layer of security. Many of these features are unique to Kali and can be found nowhere else. We&amp;rsquo;ve started tallying these features and linking them from our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/">Kali documentation page&lt;/a> - check it out, it&amp;rsquo;s growing to be an impressive list!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the next few days, &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/">Offensive Security&lt;/a> will post Virtual Machine and custom ARM images for the 1.0.7 release. We will announce the availability of these images via our blogs and Twitter feeds, so stay tuned!.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux Metapackages</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-metapackages/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-metapackages/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-metapackages/images/kali-meta-packages.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>One of our goals when developing Kali Linux was to provide multiple &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/kali-meta.git">metapackages&lt;/a> that would allow us to easily install subsets of tools based on their particular needs. Until recently, we only had a handful of these meta packages but we have since expanded the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/">metapackage list&lt;/a> to include far more options:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>kali-linux&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kali-linux-all&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kali-linux-forensic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kali-linux-full&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kali-linux-gpu&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kali-linux-pwtools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kali-linux-rfid&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kali-linux-sdr&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kali-linux-top10&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kali-linux-voip&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kali-linux-web&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kali-linux-wireless&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These metapackages allow for easy installation of certain tools in a specific field, or alternatively, for the installation of a full Kali suite. All of the Kali metapackages follow a particular naming convention, starting with &amp;ldquo;kali-linux&amp;rdquo; so if you want to see which metapackages are available, you can search for them as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt-get update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt-cache search kali-linux
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Although we tried to make the metapackage names self-explanatory, we are limited in the practical length we can use, so let&amp;rsquo;s take a brief look at each of them and see how much disk space is used by each one:&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="kali-linux">kali-linux&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>&lt;strong>kali-linux&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> metapackage is a completely bare-bones installation of Kali Linux and includes various network services such as Apache and SSH, the Kali kernel, and a number of version control applications like git, svn, etc. All of the other metapackages listed below also contain &lt;em>&lt;strong>kali-linux&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>. &lt;strong>Installation Size:&lt;/strong> 1.5 GB&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="kali-linux-full">kali-linux-full&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>When you &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">download&lt;/a> a Kali Linux ISO, you are essentially downloading an installation that has the &lt;em>&lt;strong>kali-linux-full&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> metapackage installed. This package includes all of the tools you are familiar with in Kali. &lt;strong>Installation Size:&lt;/strong> 9.0 GB&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="kali-linux-all">kali-linux-all&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>In order to keep our ISO sizes reasonable, we are unable to include every single tool that we package for Kali and there are a number of tools that are not able to be used depending on hardware, such as various GPU tools. If you want to install every available Kali Linux package, you can install the &lt;em>&lt;strong>kali-linux-all&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> metapackage. &lt;strong>Installation Size:&lt;/strong> 15 GB&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="kali-linux-top10">kali-linux-top10&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>In Kali Linux, we have a sub-menu called &amp;ldquo;Top 10 Security Tools&amp;rdquo;. The &lt;em>&lt;strong>kali-linux-top10&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> metapackage will install all of these tools for you in one fell swoop. &lt;strong>Installation Size:&lt;/strong> 3.5 GB&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-metapackages/images/top10-menu.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="kali-linux-forensic">kali-linux-forensic&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>If you are doing forensics work, you don&amp;rsquo;t want your analysis system to contain a bunch of unnecessary tools. To the rescue comes the &lt;em>&lt;strong>kali-linux-forensic&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> metapackage, which only contains the forensics tools in Kali. &lt;strong>Installation Size:&lt;/strong> 3.1 GB&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="kali-linux-gpu">kali-linux-gpu&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>GPU utilities are very powerful but need special hardware in order to function correctly. For this reason, they are not included in the default Kali Linux installation but you can install them all at once with &lt;em>&lt;strong>kali-linux-gpu&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> and get cracking. &lt;strong>Installation Size:&lt;/strong> 4.8 GB&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="kali-linux-pwtools">kali-linux-pwtools&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>&lt;strong>kali-linux-pwtools&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> metapackage contains over 40 different password cracking utilities as well as the GPU tools contained in &lt;em>&lt;strong>kali-linux-gpu&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>. &lt;strong>Installation Size:&lt;/strong> 6.0 GB&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="kali-linux-rfid">kali-linux-rfid&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>For our users who are doing RFID research and exploitation, we have the &lt;em>&lt;strong>kali-linux-rfid&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> metapackage containing all of the RFID tools available in Kali Linux. &lt;strong>Installation Size:&lt;/strong> 1.5 GB&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="kali-linux-sdr">kali-linux-sdr&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>&lt;strong>kali-linux-sdr&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> metapackage contains a large selection of tools for your Software Defined Radio hacking needs. &lt;strong>Installation Size:&lt;/strong> 2.4 GB&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="kali-linux-voip">kali-linux-voip&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Many people have told us they use Kali Linux to conduct VoIP testing and research so they will be happy to know we now have a dedicated &lt;em>&lt;strong>kali-linux-voip&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> metapackage with 20+ tools. &lt;strong>Installation Size:&lt;/strong> 1.8 GB&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="kali-linux-web">kali-linux-web&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Web application assessments are very common in the field of penetration testing and for this reason, Kali includes the &lt;em>&lt;strong>kali-linux-web&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> metapackage containing dozens of tools related to web application hacking. &lt;strong>Installation Size:&lt;/strong> 4.9 GB&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="kali-linux-wireless">kali-linux-wireless&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Like web applications, many penetration testing assessments are targeted towards wireless networks. The &lt;em>&lt;strong>kali-linux-wireless&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> metapackage contains all the tools you&amp;rsquo;ll need in one easy to install package. &lt;strong>Installation Size:&lt;/strong> 6.6 GB&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To see the list of tools included in a metapackage, you can use simple &lt;strong>apt&lt;/strong> commands. For example, to list all the tools included in the &lt;strong>kali-linux-web&lt;/strong> metapackage, we could:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt-cache show kali-linux-web | grep Depends

&lt;p>&lt;strong>EDIT&lt;/strong>: For updated Kali Rolling images in the Amazon AWS, check &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-aws-cloud/">this post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After several weeks of &amp;ldquo;back and forth&amp;rdquo; with the Amazon EC2 team, Kali Linux has finally been approved into the Amazon EC2 marketplace. This means that our users can now activate and access Kali Linux instances in the Amazon cloud quickly and easily. We are &amp;ldquo;selling&amp;rdquo; these images on the marketplace for &lt;strong>free&lt;/strong>, so other than the regular amazon charges, there no extras to pay. We have currently published a single 64 bit &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08LL91KKB">minimal instance of Kali Linux&lt;/a>, which can be found in the marketplace by searching for &amp;ldquo;Kali Linux&amp;rdquo; or accessed via its &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08LL91KKB">direct link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-amazon-ec2-ami/images/amazon-kali-marketplace.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to Amazon AMI image guidelines, the instance does not use the root account by default. Once you have obtained your SSH key from Amazon, you need to connect to your instance using the &amp;ldquo;kali&amp;rdquo; user, from which you can then sudo to root if needed. The image is a barebones Kali installation, allowing you to install any toolset you like, while still remaining small and lightweight. If you plan on using Kali Linux for any aggressive scanning on the Internet, make sure to update the Amazon security team through their &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/">Penetration Testing Request&lt;/a> form.&lt;/p>

One set of such tools belongs to the &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/pass-the-hash-toolkit-winexe-updates/">Pass-the-Hash&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> toolkit, which includes favorites such as &lt;strong>pth-winexe&lt;/strong> among others, already packaged in Kali Linux. An example of easy command line access using pth-winexe is shown below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/passing-hash-remote-desktop/images/Screen-Shot-2014-01-14-at-9.53.44-AM.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We constantly strive to include new, useful tools to our repositories. Sometimes we feel that some of these tools do not get the attention they deserve and go under-reported. One such recent addition is the version of FreeRDP, which allows a penetration tester to use a password hash instead of a plain text password for authentication to the remote desktop service in Windows 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s the big deal, you say? Traditional &amp;ldquo;Pass-the-Hash&amp;rdquo; attacks can be very powerful, but they are limited to command line access. Although in most cases that is enough, sometimes GUI access is just a better way to accomplish things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few months ago, Mark Lowe from the Portcullis Labs published a &lt;a href="https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/blog/new-restricted-admin-feature-of-rdp-8-1-allows-pass-the-hash/">blog post&lt;/a> on research he conducted against Windows 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1 RDP security improvements. It turns out that Microsoft, in their quest to mitigate &amp;ldquo;Pass-the-Hash&amp;rdquo; attacks, introduced something called &amp;ldquo;Restricted Admin&amp;rdquo; mode. You can read more about it &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/kfalde/restricted-admin-mode-for-rdp-in-windows-8-1-2012-r2">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Inadvertently however, this new security feature actually enabled the use of a password hash for RDP authentication purposes, thereby giving many pentesters once again a reason to smile. To add to the validity of the research by Mark, the FreeRDP project has added native support for Pass-the-Hash authentication to the FreeRDP package, which is now in Kali repos. To enjoy this new feature, simply install freerdp-x11.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt-get update
apt-get install freerdp-x11
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The new xfreerdp executable supports the &amp;ldquo;/pth&amp;rdquo; flag as shown below using our &amp;ldquo;offsec&amp;rdquo; domain user and the &amp;ldquo;password&amp;rdquo; hash.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/passing-hash-remote-desktop/images/pth-rdp.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s it! RDP sessions using harvested password hashes. Again, keep in mind that this only works on Windows 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1. To the best of our knowledge, the &amp;ldquo;Restricted Admin&amp;rdquo; feature has not been backported yet and considering this, it may never be.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Nuke your Encrypted Kali Installation</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/nuke-kali-linux-luks/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/nuke-kali-linux-luks/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/nuke-kali-linux-luks/images/kali-nuke-restore.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s been a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/1ujsv4/emergency_self_destruction_of_luks_in_kali_linux/">fair amount of discussion&lt;/a> around the recently introduced &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/emergency-self-destruction-luks-kali/">LUKS nuke patch&lt;/a> we added to the cryptsetup package in Kali Linux. We wanted to take this opportunity to better explain this feature, as well as demonstrate some useful approaches which are worthwhile getting to know.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="luks-nuke-in-a-nutshell">LUKS Nuke in a Nutshell&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As explained well By Michael Lee in his &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/developers-mull-adding-data-nuke-to-kali-linux/">ZDNet article&lt;/a>, when creating an encrypted LUKS container, a master key is generated at random. A passphrase is then used to encrypt the master key in turn. This process means that the passphrase is not directly coupled to the data. That is, if two sets of identical data are encrypted and the same passphrase used, the master keys remain unique to each set and cannot be swapped out. What this also means however, is that regardless of the passphrase used, if the master key is lost, recovering data is impossible. This process conveniently lends itself to being used as a nuke by deliberately wiping the keys.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="example-use-case-of-luks-nuke">Example Use Case of LUKS Nuke&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Our main purpose for introducing this feature in Kali Linux is to simplify the process of securely traveling with confidential client information. While &amp;ldquo;LUKS Nuking&amp;rdquo; your drive will result in an inaccessible disk, it &lt;strong>is&lt;/strong> possible to backup your keyslots beforehand and restore them after the fact. What this allows us to do is to &amp;ldquo;brick&amp;rdquo; our sensitive laptops before any travel, separate ourselves from the restoration keys (which we encrypt), and then &amp;ldquo;restore&amp;rdquo; them to the machines once back in a safe location. This way, if our hardware is lost or otherwise accessed midway through our travels, no one is able to restore the data on it, including ourselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are other ways to delete your keyslots, however the advantage of the Nuke option is it is quick, easy, and does not require you to fully login to your Kali installation. If you maintain a backup of your header, you can Nuke the keyslots whenever you feel uncomfortable. Then conduct a restoration when you feel secure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="try-this-for-yourself">Try this for yourself&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s go through the motions of encrypting, backing up, destroying, and then restoring your data using Kali Linux. Start by downloading and installing Kali Linux 1.0.6 with Full Disk Encryption. Once that is done, you can verify your information as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali-crypto:~# cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda5
LUKS header information for /dev/sda5
Version: 1
Cipher name: aes
Cipher mode: xts-plain64

Key Slot 1: DISABLED
Key Slot 2: DISABLED
Key Slot 3: DISABLED
Key Slot 4: DISABLED
Key Slot 5: DISABLED
Key Slot 6: DISABLED
Key Slot 7: DISABLED
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>As you can see, we have slot 0 enabled with slots 1 to 7 unused. At this point, we will add our nuke key.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali-crypto:~# apt install cryptsetup-nuke-password
root@kali-crypto:~# dpkg-reconfigure cryptsetup-nuke-password
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This didn&amp;rsquo;t change anything to the LUKS container, instead it installed the nuke password and a small hook in the initrd. This hook will detect when you enter your nuke password at boot time and it will call &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>cryptsetup luksErase&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; on your LUKS container at that time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wonderful. Now we need to back up the encryption keys. This can easily be done with the &amp;ldquo;luksHeaderBackup&amp;rdquo; option.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali-crypto:~# cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup --header-backup-file luksheader.back /dev/sda5
root@kali-crypto:~# file luksheader.back
luksheader.back: LUKS encrypted file, ver 1 [aes, xts-plain64, sha1] UUID: 126d0121-05e4-4f1d-94d8-bed88e8c246d
root@kali-crypto:~#
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>So, in our case we would like to encrypt this data for storage. There are a number of ways this could be done, however we will use openssl to make the process quick and easy using default tools in Kali.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali-crypto:~# openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in luksheader.back -out luksheader.back.enc
enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:
Verifying - enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:
root@kali-crypto:~# ls -lh luksheader.back*
-r-------- 1 root root 2.0M Jan 9 13:42 luksheader.back
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2.0M Jan 9 15:50 luksheader.back.enc
root@kali-crypto:~# file luksheader.back*
luksheader.back: LUKS encrypted file, ver 1 [aes, xts-plain64, sha1] UUID: 126d0121-05e4-4f1d-94d8-bed88e8c246d
luksheader.back.enc: data
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Great, now we have the encrypted header ready to be backed up. In this case, we would like to place the header somewhere that it is easily accessible. This could be as simple as on a USB thumb drive that is kept in a safe location. At this point, lets reboot and make use of the Nuke key and see how Kali responds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we used the Nuke key, and as expected we can no longer boot into Kali. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what happened on the actual disk by booting up into a Kali live CD and dumping the LUKS header again.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda5

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since our last minor release which makes 1.0.6 a more significant update than usual. With a new 3.12 kernel, &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/emergency-self-destruction-luks-kali/">a LUKS nuke feature&lt;/a>, new &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm">Kali ARM build scripts&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-cloud-build">Kali AMAZON AMI and Google Compute image generation scripts&lt;/a>, not to mention numerous tool additions and updates - this release is really heavily laden with goodness. For more information about what&amp;rsquo;s new in this release, check the &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/changelog_page.php">Kali changelog&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="kali-arm-build-scripts-now-available">Kali ARM Build Scripts Now Available&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This new release brings with it the introduction of the &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm">Offensive Security Trusted ARM image scripts&lt;/a> - a set of slowly growing scripts that are able to build Kali Linux images for various ARM devices. These scripts will replace the growing number of actual ARM image releases we have in order to reduce the exponentially growing amount of traffic we serve on each release. We will release a short blog post about how to use these scripts in the next few days.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="luks-nuke-patch-added-to-cryptsetup">LUKS Nuke Patch Added to cryptsetup&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A couple of days ago, we demonstrated a cool patch for cryptsetup, which introduces a self destruction feature. The response to this post was overwhelmingly positive, as many people voted to see this feature included in Kali Linux. Therefore, we included this patch into our cryptsetup package yesterday, making the &lt;strong>luksAddNuke&lt;/strong> options available to all Kali users by default. The patch is non-invasive and will not change anything for anyone that does not want to make use of it. No action is necessary if you currently use LUKS and don&amp;rsquo;t want to utilize the key nuke feature. The updated cryptsetup package is present in Kali 1.0.6 by default. We&amp;rsquo;d like to take a moment to thank everyone who participated in the poll for voicing their opinion. This kind of feedback is very useful for us, giving us a better feel for the type of features to add in the future. In an upcoming blog post, we will take the opportunity to better explain this new feature and show you how to test it out.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="updated-instructions-for-building-vmware-tools-with-kernel-312">Updated Instructions for Building VMware Tools with Kernel 3.12&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>VMware Tools always lags behind new kernels, which always causes us headaches and this time is no exception. At the time of this release, VMware Tools does not cleanly compile against kernel 3.12 and requires a set of patches. We have posted these &lt;a href="https://github.com/offensive-security/kali-vmware-tools-patches">Kali Linux VMware Tools patches on GitHub&lt;/a> along with instructions on how to use them. We suspect that these build issues will go away in future releases of VMware Tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="kali-linux-amazon-amigoogle-compute-build-scripts-now-available">Kali Linux Amazon AMI/Google Compute Build Scripts Now Available&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Yay! This was on our todo list for quite awhile and we&amp;rsquo;re happy to bring this feature out at last. A &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-cloud-build">set of scripts&lt;/a> that enables you to build your own custom Amazon AMI and Google Compute cloud images. If you intend to use the images for any real work, you should first consult with the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/">terms of service&lt;/a> of the cloud provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="separation-of-kali-official-images-and-offensive-security-contributed-images">Separation of Kali Official Images and Offensive Security Contributed Images&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Due to the ever growing number of ARM images &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/">Offensive Security&lt;/a> is contributing as well as the high demand of more flavours of VMware images, we&amp;rsquo;ve separated the Official Kali images from Offensive Security contributed images. This allows us to generate more VMware image flavours (amd64, i486, i686-pae), as well as increased flexibility in future releases. To find updated VMware and custom ARM images, visit the &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/">Offensive Security Custom Image Download Page&lt;/a>. Please bear with us as we update images on this server in the next few days.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="improving-kali-linux-package-features">Improving Kali Linux Package Features&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In the past couple of weeks, jerichodotm has been helping us add &lt;a href="https://wiki.debian.org/debian/watch/">watch&lt;/a> files to our Kali packages. These watch files allow us to monitor upstream tarball releases for updates in a much more reliable manner. Once this process is complete, we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to monitor new upstream software updates with much more ease. For example, if you want to check if there&amp;rsquo;s a new upstream release of nmap, you could do the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# apt-get install devscripts
root@kali:~# apt-get source nmap
root@kali:~# cd nmap-6.40/
root@kali:~/nmap-6.40# uscan --no-download --verbose

&lt;p>Lastly, if you already have a Kali Linux installation up and running, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to download a new ISO. You can easily upgrade your installation to the latest and greatest Kali Linux has to offer as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# apt-get update
root@kali:~# apt-get dist-upgrade
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h4 id="engage">&amp;hellip;.Engage.&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re really happy with this release and are looking forward to completing our next goals with 1.0.7. As usual, you are welcome to visit our &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/">Kali Linux forums&lt;/a> (which now default to HTTPS), read up on our &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/">official documentation&lt;/a>, submit &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">bugs and patches&lt;/a>, or chat with us in &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/community/kali-linux-irc-channel/">IRC&lt;/a>, irc.oftc.net, #kali-linux.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/penetration-testing/">penetration testers&lt;/a>, we often need to travel with sensitive data stored on our laptops. Of course, we use full disk encryption wherever possible, including our Kali Linux machines, which tend to contain the most sensitive materials.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Setting up &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/hard-disk-install/">full disk encryption with Kali&lt;/a> is a simple process. The Kali installer includes a straightforward process for setting up encrypted partitions with LVM and LUKS. Once encrypted, the Kali operating system requires a password at boot time to allow the OS to boot and decrypt your drive, thus protecting this data in case your laptop is stolen. Managing decryption keys and partitions is done using the cryptsetup utility.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="nuking-our-kali-linux-fde-installation">Nuking our Kali Linux FDE Installation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A couple of days ago, one of us had the idea of adding a &amp;ldquo;nuke&amp;rdquo; option to our Kali install. In other words, having a boot password that would destroy, rather than decrypt, the data on our drive. A few Google searches later, we found an old &lt;a href="http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/103692/index.html">cryptsetup patch&lt;/a> by Juergen Pabel which does just that, adding a &amp;ldquo;nuke&amp;rdquo; password to cryptsetup, which when used, deletes all keyslots and makes the data on the drive inaccessible. We ported this patch for a recent version of cryptsetup and posted it on &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/cryptsetup-nuke-keys">Github&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="testing-the-luks-nuke-patch">Testing the LUKS Nuke Patch&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This feature isn&amp;rsquo;t implemented yet in Kali as we wanted to gather some user feedback before applying this patch to base images. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to try it our yourself, these are the build instructions. Start by running an LVM encrypted installation in Kali and set a decryption password. Once done, download the cryptsetup package source and apply our patch to it. Proceed to build the patched package as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# apt-get source cryptsetup
root@kali:~# git clone https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/cryptsetup-nuke-keys
root@kali:~# cd cryptsetup-1.6.1/
root@kali:~/cryptsetup-1.6.1# patch -p1 &amp;lt; ../cryptsetup-nuke-keys/cryptsetup_1.6.1+nuke_keys.diff

patching file lib/setup.c
patching file src/cryptsetup.c
root@kali:~/cryptsetup-1.6.1# dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Once the package has built, install the cryptsetup packages to get our &lt;strong>nuke&lt;/strong> option implemented:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~/cryptsetup-1.6.1# ls -l ../*crypt*.deb
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 149430 Jan 4 21:34 ../cryptsetup_1.6.1-1kali0_amd64.deb

root@kali:~/cryptsetup-1.6.1# dpkg -i ../libcryptsetup*.deb
root@kali:~/cryptsetup-1.6.1# dpkg -i ../cryptsetup*.deb
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now that our patched cryptsetup package has been installed, we can go ahead and add a &amp;ldquo;nuke&amp;rdquo; key to our setup:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# cryptsetup luksAddNuke /dev/sda5
Enter any existing passphrase: (existing passphrase)
Enter new passphrase for key slot: (nuke passphrase)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="hey-dude-wheres-my-drive">Hey Dude, Where&amp;rsquo;s my Drive?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>On any subsequent reboots, you will be asked for the LUKS decryption password each time as usual. If for whatever reason, you were to enter the nuke password, the saved keys would be purged rendering the data inaccessible. Should we implement this patch in the cryptsetup package? Let us know what you think via this quick poll. We&amp;rsquo;ll keep this poll open for a couple of weeks and keep you posted with any further developments of this feature.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-plain">Cryptseup Nuke Option in Kali
Add nuke features to cryptsetup ?*
- [ ] Yes, add this feature!
- [ ] Stop bothering me
- [ ] No, leave cryptsetup alone.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> The nuke patch has been introduced to Kali Linux and is available by default in &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-6-release/">Kali Linux v1.0.6&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> We&amp;rsquo;ve posted an example use-case for the Nuke feature in a later &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/nuke-kali-linux-luks/">How to nuke your encrypted Kali Linux installation&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; blog post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> As of July 2019, Kali Linux no longer ships this cryptsetup patch, instead we introduced a cryptsetup-nuke-password package that provides a similar feature without modifying cryptsetup.&lt;/p>

Whether it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux/kali-linux-on-galaxy-note/">Galaxy Note&lt;/a> or a USB stick sized &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/ss808-mk808/">SS808&lt;/a>, we want to see Kali run on it. You can therefore imagine our excitement, when we first laid our eyes on the &lt;a href="http://utilite-computer.com/web/utilite-pro-specifications/">Utilite pro&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Utilite Pro is a &lt;strong>quad core&lt;/strong> ARM cortex-A9 machine with up to &lt;strong>4 GB&lt;/strong> of RAM, up to &lt;strong>512 GB mSATA SSD&lt;/strong>, HDMI and DVI-D output, &lt;strong>dual (2x) 1GB nics&lt;/strong>, a built in wireless card and &lt;strong>4 USB ports&lt;/strong>. And its fanless. With those type of specs, this little beauty was unlikely to skip our radars. We wanted Kali Linux on that baby, &lt;strong>real bad&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We took this opportunity to create and publish the &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm">Offensive Security Kali Linux contributed ARM images&lt;/a>, and thought we&amp;rsquo;d demonstrate the use of these scripts, and show you how to get Kali linux on the Utilite Pro. From there, the options are endless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Utilite Pro came with Ubuntu preinstalled. The first thing we wanted to do, is update the machines uBoot bootloader image, to allow for support of 1.8V microSD cards.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@utilite:~# apt-get install mtd-utils

&lt;p>Once that was done, we whipped out our Offensive Security Trusted Contributed ARM image scripts, and let our Utilite image builder script loose. On a separate 32 bit Kali Linux machine, we set up all the pre-requisites to build our ARM image, and make sure we have at least 10GB of free space. We start with downloading and setting up the ARM cross compiler and the build scripts:&lt;/p>

As usual, users with Kali already installed just need to run a simple update to get the latest goodness:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kali:~# apt-get update
root@kali:~# apt-get dist-upgrade
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve also received updated ARM images from Offensive Security, which bring several fixes to issues found in the 1.0.4 releases. Kali Linux has specific ARM images for 9 separate hardware devices/families, including the Raspberry Pi, Galaxy Note 10.1, BeagleBone Black, Odroid U2, Odroid XU (!) and more. While Kali Linux works on all the hardware above natively, don&amp;rsquo;t forget you can get Kali Linux installed on almost any Android phone or tablet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Software Defined Radio (SDR) researchers will be especially pleased to know that we have made some significant tool additions in this growing field. With some great input and suggestions from @NowSec, we placed a great deal of focus in the past few weeks on adding numerous SDR tools and drivers to our arsenal:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>kalibrate-rtl&lt;/li>
&lt;li>gr-air-modes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RTLSDR Scanner&lt;/li>
&lt;li>gr-scan&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rtl-sdr&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gqrx&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GR Extras&lt;/li>
&lt;li>gr-baz&lt;/li>
&lt;li>gr-osmosdr&lt;/li>
&lt;li>gr-iqbal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>gr-fcdproplus&lt;/li>
&lt;li>UHD support&lt;/li>
&lt;li>HackRF support&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RTL2832U support&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Funcube Dongle Pro+ support&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-5-release/images/SDR_menu.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also forked &lt;a href="https://www.gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki">GNU Radio&lt;/a> from the Debian repositories and upgraded it to version 3.6.5.1, a task that sounds much simpler than it really is since its dependencies have dependencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-5-release/images/gnuradio-depends.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re very pleased with the end result and these additions have given us the excuse to play around in the field of SDR, which is filled with great potential for research. This isn&amp;rsquo;t the end of our support for SDR, but only the beginning as we intend to combine our rock-solid stability with cutting edge device support to become the &lt;a href="http://needsec.com/kali-linux-improves-software-defined-radio-sdr-support/">best platform for SDR research&lt;/a> in the industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-5-release/images/gqrx-kali.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="but-wait-theres-more">But Wait, There&amp;rsquo;s More!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This release of Kali Linux isn&amp;rsquo;t only about SDR, though. For our users who love hacking NFC, we have also beefed up our suite of tools for manipulating MIFARE cards with updates to libnfc, mfoc, and mfcuk along with the addition of mfterm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope you enjoy this release as much as we enjoyed making it.

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-android-linux-deploy/images/linux-deploy-kali-list-00.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Getting Kali Linux to run on ARM hardware has been a major goal for us since day one. So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve built &lt;strong>native&lt;/strong> images for the Samsung Chromebook, Odroid U2, Raspberry Pi, RK3306, Galaxy Note 10.1, CuBox, Efika MX, and BeagleBone Black to name a few. This however does not mean you cannot install Kali Linux in a chroot on almost any modern device that runs Android. In fact, the developers of &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.meefik.linuxdeploy&amp;amp;hl=en">Linux Deploy&lt;/a> have made it extremely easy to get any number of Linux distributions installed in a chroot environment using a simple GUI builder.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites&lt;/h5>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A device running Android 2.1 and above, rooted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At least 5 GB free space on internal or external storage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A fast, wireless internet connection.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Patience to wait for a distribution to bootstrap from the network.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h5 id="configuring-linux-deploy-for-kali">Configuring Linux Deploy for Kali&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s actually very little to be done to get Kali installed. By choosing &lt;strong>Kali Linux&lt;/strong> in the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Distribution&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; tab, you&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much covered the important stuff. Optionally, you can choose your architecture, verify that the Kali mirror is correct, set your installation type and location on your Android device, etc. Generally speaking, the defaults provided by Linux Deploy are good to begin with.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="building-the-kali-image">Building the Kali Image&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-android-linux-deploy/images/install-kali-linux-deploy.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you are happy with all the settings, hitting the &amp;ldquo;install&amp;rdquo; button will start a Kali Linux bootstrap directly from our repositories. Depending on your Internet connection speed, this process could take a while. You&amp;rsquo;ll be downloading a base install of Kali Linux (with no tools) at minimum.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="starting-up-your-chrooted-kali">Starting up your chrooted Kali&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Once the installation is complete, you can have Linux Deploy automatically mount and load up your Kali Linux chroot image. This also includes the starting of services such as SSH and VNC for easier remote access. All of this is automagically done by hitting the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>start&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; button. You should see Linux Deploy setting up your image with output similar to the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-android-linux-deploy/images/linux-deploy-mount.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this stage, Linux Deploy has started a VNC and SSH server inside your chrooted Kali image. You can connect to the Kali session remotely using the IP address assigned to your Android device (in my case, 10.0.0.10).&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="logging-in-to-your-chrooted-kali">Logging in to your chrooted Kali&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Now you can use either a SSH or VNC client to access your Kali instance. The VNC password is &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>changeme&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; and the SSH credentials are &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>android&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; for the username (configured via Linux Deploy) and &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>changeme&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; as the password.&lt;/p>

&lt;h5 id="image-size-considerations">Image Size Considerations&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>If left unchanged, Linux Deploy will automatically set an image size of around 4 GB, for a &amp;ldquo;naked&amp;rdquo; installation of Kali. If you would like to install additional Kali tools down the road, you might want to consider using a larger image size, which is configurable via the settings in Linux Deploy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="local-vnc-connections">Local VNC Connections&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>We had to try a couple of VNC clients to get one to work properly. Although controlling Kali through a local VNC client isn&amp;rsquo;t the most convenient of tasks, it certainly is possible. However, we suspect that most people will be SSH&amp;rsquo;ing into this instance. The picture below was overlayed with a Kali Linux desktop screenshot taken from a Galaxy S4.&lt;/p>

This bug was high priority in our TODO as encrypted installs are an important feature in our industry so we wanted to squash this bug ASAP. This article will describe the process of debugging, identifying, and fixing this bug in Kali, and ultimately in Debian as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bug itself was weird; installing Kali with the &amp;ldquo;LVM Encrypted&amp;rdquo; option would result in a failed boot once the installation was done:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/tracking-fixing-installer-bugs/images/kali-lvm-boot-bug.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The work-around suggested in the bug report indicated that the &lt;strong>/etc/crypttab&lt;/strong> file was empty. By manually remounting the encrypted partition, repopulating it with the required parameters, and then updating the initramfs, the machine would boot successfully into the encrypted partition again. Most definately annoying and far from practical.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now with the problem well defined, the solution seemed simple. Something was probably wrong with the way &lt;strong>/etc/crypttab&lt;/strong> gets updated during the installation process. Our next step was to investigate the scripts that are responsible for this update and see if there are any bugs in the file update process. But how would you locate the exact script responsible for this update and how could we figure out what package it lives in?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To our rescue comes &lt;a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/CheckOut">DebianInstaller&lt;/a>. Using this set of scripts, we checked out the whole DebianInstaller source tree. This would allow us to search for the scripts that affect &lt;strong>/etc/crypttab&lt;/strong> with much greater ease.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kalima:~# svn co svn://anonscm.debian.org/svn/d-i/trunk debian-installer
root@kalima:~# cd debian-installer
root@kalima:~/debian-installer# scripts/git-setup
root@kalima:~/debian-installer# mr -p checkout
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Once all the repositories had been checked out, we could simply grep for any files that reference the &lt;strong>/etc/crypttab&lt;/strong> file as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-console">root@kalima:~/debian-installer# grep -r '/etc/crypttab' * |grep -v ^manual
...
packages/partman-crypto/finish.d/crypto_config:# dm-crypt: creates /etc/crypttab entries
packages/partman-crypto/finish.d/crypto_config: echo &amp;quot;$target $source $keyfile $opts&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /target/etc/crypttab
...
root@kalima:~/debian-installer#
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We see above that it&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>crypto_config&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; script that writes to &lt;strong>/etc/crypttab&lt;/strong>, which is located in the &lt;strong>partman-crypto&lt;/strong> package.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ideally, we would like to debug this script and see where the problem is, but how would you do this in a live installation media? The answer is relatively simple - we just had to pop open a command prompt during the installation process. The trick is to invoke our debugging shell (by pressing CTRL+ALT+F2) during the right stage of the installation - in our case we needed to interrupt the installer before the &lt;strong>crypto_config&lt;/strong> script was run but after the &lt;strong>partman-crypto&lt;/strong> udeb was installed, so the beginning of the partitioning process would be a good spot. We proceeded to edit the &lt;strong>/lib/partman/finish.d/55_crypto_config&lt;/strong> and added &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>set -x&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; at the start of the script:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/tracking-fixing-installer-bugs/images/partman-script-debug.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We then let the installer do its thing and just before the installation completed, we took a peek at &lt;strong>/var/log/syslog&lt;/strong> in another shell. To our surprise, we saw that the &lt;strong>/etc/crypttab&lt;/strong> file *was* being updated, contrary to our initial beliefs, as can be seen in the syslog of the installation. &lt;strong>WTH&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-plain">Aug 28 21:57:42 main-menu[954]: (process:9810): crypttab_add_entry
Aug 28 21:57:42 main-menu[954]: (process:9810): /dev/sda5

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This is where we started scratching our heads. If the problem was not in the writing of this file (as we expected), then why was there an empty &lt;strong>/etc/crypttab&lt;/strong> file after the installation? Perhaps the problem was not in &lt;strong>partman-crypto&lt;/strong> after all, but in how &lt;strong>live-build&lt;/strong> generates our ISOs? We tested this theory of ours by using a Kali mini installation ISO (not built via live-build) and noticed that the LVM encrypted installs were working fine when using that installation media.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We know that the live-installer uses &lt;em>tar&lt;/em> to copy the whole live filesystem into a mounted &lt;strong>/target&lt;/strong> directory and it assumes that the filesystems are empty, which is mostly true since they were just created by partman. This means that any pre-existing file can be overwritten if they are also in the live image, which was happening to &lt;strong>/etc/crypttab&lt;/strong> in this case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further examination revealed that the problem was in &lt;strong>live-installer&lt;/strong>, whereby it overwrites the generated &lt;strong>/etc/crypttab&lt;/strong>. The live-installer already has some provisions to not overwrite &lt;strong>/etc/fstab&lt;/strong>, so it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of generalizing that rule and including the &lt;strong>/etc/crypttab&lt;/strong> file as well:&lt;/p>

Have you ever wondered or asked yourself why exactly we consider Kali to be so &amp;ldquo;Powerful&amp;rdquo;? Why is Kali any different or better from say, an Ubuntu machine with a bunch of security tools preinstalled on it? After all, &lt;strong>our nmap package isn&amp;rsquo;t any better than anyone else&amp;rsquo;s, is it&lt;/strong>?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="flexible-penetration-testing-platform">Flexible Penetration Testing Platform&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One of the major benefits of Kali Linux is that &lt;strong>it&amp;rsquo;s not merely a bunch of tools&lt;/strong> pre-packaged into a Linux distribution. &lt;strong>Kali is a real &amp;ldquo;Penetration Testing Platform&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> - and that&amp;rsquo;s not just a cool buzzword we use. Derived from the rock solid Debian platform, Kali is flexible enough to provide features such as:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;strong>Rolling distribution with seamless updates and upgrades.&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;strong>Automated installations using preseed files including network and PXE installs.&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;strong>Ability to easily create custom Kali images using live-build, with multiple WM support.&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;strong>Whole disk encryption during installation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;strong>Multiple ARM images for a wide variety of hardware&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;strong>Accessibility support for blind and visually impaired users.&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;strong>Bleeding edge repositories.&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Each one of these features provides multiple interesting opportunities for penetration testers, security auditors, and forensics folks alike. We would like to present a few simple scenarios which we had the opportunity to implement, demonstrating just how powerful Kali Linux can be.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="scenario-1---simple-deployment-of-kali-scanning-agents">Scenario 1 - Simple Deployment of Kali Scanning Agents&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Consider the following scenario - you are a security administrator of a multi-national corporation. You are asked to run a vulnerability scan on each of your twelve offices, located in different parts of the world. Naturally, you have an insignificant budget to complete this task and the VA results need to be submitted to management ASAP. How would you go about accomplishing this task? This would be the &amp;ldquo;Kali&amp;rdquo; way:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Deploy a minimal installation of Kali &amp;ldquo;agents&amp;rdquo; using a PXE setup and a preseed file to all locations. The agent should include an OpenSSH server, Metasploit, and OpenVAS. If this is not possible in some of your offices, you can easily create a custom Kali ISO using a live build recipe and have Kali installed in those locations manually. Either way, Kali should be configured to automatically start the SSH, metasploit, msfrpcd, and openvas services at boot time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Once all our Kali agents are up and running, we connect to the msfrpcd service on each of them and use the metasploit to openvas bridge to kick off a local vulnerability scan in each geographic location. Once the scans are complete, we can either download the scan reports from each location, or choose to verify the exploitability of the discovered vulnerabilities by importing our scans into Metasploit and logging any successful sessions which are created.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h3 id="scenario-2---battery-powered-portable-mifare-rfid-card-cloner">Scenario 2 - Battery Powered Portable Mifare RFID Card Cloner&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Suppose for a moment that you are a security auditor tasked to test a standard Mifare-based door system. You want to be able to dump the contents of a valid RFID card in the system in order to clone it later on. You have only a few minutes to preform the cloning task once you&amp;rsquo;ve been handed the valid card.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Install Kali Linux on an SS808 arm device, powered by a lithium battery and loop an NFC tool such as &lt;strong>mfoc&lt;/strong> to dump any card presented to it, saving the dumps on a local SD card.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Once dumped, use the Mifare card data to create a clone of the original card - task completed!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Alright, now we&amp;rsquo;re just showing off, we know! But this screenshot was too cool to just ignore, so we had to post it.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Consider running your favorite web based security tool, such as OpenVAS, or &lt;strong>Metasploit Pro&lt;/strong> directly from your tablet. With 4 or 8 cores, working on small ARM devices is no longer the slow and painful process it once was.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Hopefully, these brief scenarios will spark your imagination and encourage you to explore all that Kali Linux has to offer and make you realize that the distribution is more than just a bunch of tools cobbled together haphazardly. We are very proud of our distribution and are committed to making it the best it can possibly be thanks to the help and suggestions of the security community.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux 1.0.4 Summer Update Release</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-4-release/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-4-release/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-4-release/images/kali-1.0.4-release.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>In keeping with our tradition of publishing new releases during the annual &lt;a href="https://www.blackhat.com/">Black Hat&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.defcon.org/">DEF CON&lt;/a> conferences, we are pleased to announce the availability of &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali Linux 1.0.4&lt;/a>.

These tools have been on the top of our wish list for a while and some of them were quite challenging to package. Before we start telling you of our packaging woes, here&amp;rsquo;s how to update your Kali installation and get the latest goodness from our repos:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade
apt-get install passing-the-hash unicornscan winexe
apt-get install unicornscan enum4linux polenum
apt-get install nfspy firmware-mod-kit wmis
# and if you haven't already:
apt-get install nipper-ng jsql oclgausscrack ghost-phisher uniscan
apt-get install lbd automater arachni bully inguma sslsplit dumpzilla
apt-get install owasp-mantra-ff recon-ng ridenum regripper jd-gui
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="pass-the-hash-toolkit">Pass The Hash Toolkit&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We have *finally* finished packaging the &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/passing-the-hash/downloads">Pass the Hash Toolkit&lt;/a> in an elegant and intelligent way, thanks to samba4. Samba 4 is architectured differently than previous versions and many parts of the core functionality have been moved into libraries. This made it possible for us to easily override a couple of functions in those libraries with the help of the dynamic loader (using LD_PRELOAD) and saved us the need to recompile a patched samba in order to introduce the PTH tookit to Kali. All PTH tools and utilities have a &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>pth-&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; prefix.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="winexe">Winexe&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Winexe (also with PTH capabilities) was also challenging to get running in Kali due to &lt;a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/winexe/bugs/21/">mysterious segfaults&lt;/a> in the application on 32 bit Kali systems. Fortunately, those issues were solved and the latest Winexe is now available in the Kali repositories.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="kali-linux-release-at-def-con-21">Kali Linux Release at DEF CON 21&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We will be releasing a bugfix rollup of Kali Linux during the BlackHat and DEF CON security conferences this year - all these tool additions and updates will be available in the upcoming release. To all conference goers, see you there!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux Accessibility Improvements</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-3-release/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-3-release/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-3-release/images/kali-speech-support.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>A couple of weeks ago, we were approached (independently) by two blind security enthusiasts who both drew our attention to the fact that Kali Linux had no built-in accessibility features. This made Kali difficult, if not impossible, to both install and use from a blind or visually impaired user&amp;rsquo;s perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our first attempts at building an accessible version of Kali failed and after a bit of digging, we found that there were several upstream &lt;a href="https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/gdm3">GNOME Display Manager&lt;/a> (GDM3) bugs in &lt;a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian&lt;/a>, which prevented these accessibility features from functioning with the GDM greeter. Working together with an upstream GNOME developer, we knocked out these bugs and had the fixes implemeted in Kali, and hopefully in future builds of GDM3 in Debian. To make the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/">Kali installation&lt;/a> accessible as well, we have added a new &amp;ldquo;accessibility&amp;rdquo; boot option that triggers the speech engine during the installation process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-3-release/images/desktop-installer-small.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are very proud to have sponsored this work, which has brought much-improved accessibility features to both Kali Linux and Debian and we sincerely hope to continue receiving &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">feedback&lt;/a> from the community so we can further improve Kali Linux. We have also taken this opportunity add a new &amp;ldquo;Live Desktop&amp;rdquo; installer and have released a &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">new version of Kali Linux&lt;/a> that has these accessibility features built-in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>To activate the speech assisted installer, press &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; at boot time, and hit enter.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bleeding Edge Kali Linux</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/bleeding-edge-kali-repositories/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/bleeding-edge-kali-repositories/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/bleeding-edge-kali-repositories/images/kali-bleeding-edge-repo.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve been busy this week, still behind on our emails, but going strong with Kali development. We packaged some &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/">new tools&lt;/a> which were pointed out by the community as missing, such as &lt;strong>inguma&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>arachni&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>bully&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>lbd&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>uniscan&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>automater&lt;/strong>, as well as started to build a framework of libraries and patches for bluetooth sniffing and ubertooth tools. We also fixed the Kali Menu to be editable again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With over 300 tools in our repository, it&amp;rsquo;s close to impossible for us to keep *every* tool updated to the latest git version, all the time. A good example of this happed a few days ago, when we updated the &lt;strong>SET&lt;/strong> package. Two days after we updated the package, we got a &amp;ldquo;tool upgrade&amp;rdquo; request for SET in our bug tracker, as our package was already outdated. Seems a bit extreme? Maybe not, &lt;strong>consider the following conundrum&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You have an audit tommorrow, and you&amp;rsquo;re getting your tools ready. You boot Kali Linux up, run an &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>apt-get update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt-get upgrade&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; to make sure you&amp;rsquo;re running the latest stable versions of &lt;em>$your_favorate_tool&lt;/em>. After the update, you notice that &lt;em>$your_favorate_tool&lt;/em> has a package that was updated last week in our repositories. However, in the past week, some pretty awesome updates were added to &lt;em>$your_favorate_tool&lt;/em> upstream, and you really need those new features for the upcoming assessment. &lt;strong>What do you do ?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="worst-thing-to-do">Worst Thing To Do.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Assuming you&amp;rsquo;re not using Kali as a &amp;ldquo;Throw Away Instance&amp;rdquo;, the worst thing to do in this case is to overwrite packaged files. For example, &lt;strong>the following commands to update a tool that gets updated frequently is a big no-no&lt;/strong> and will ultimately break your install in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh"># dont update tools like this!
cd /usr/share/
rm -rf $your_favorate_tool
git clone $your_favorate_tool
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="ok-to-dobut-meh">OK To Do&amp;hellip;but, Meh.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since you &lt;strong>shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be messing with packaged files&lt;/strong>, the most common option is to svn or git checkout &lt;em>$your_favorate_tool&lt;/em> in a temporary directory and use it from there as shown below. In most cases, all the dependencies needed for the updated tool will usually already exist in Kali. Alternatively, you could opt to &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/rebuilding-a-package-from-source/">rebuild the source package&lt;/a>, which includes your updates and changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">cd ~
mkdir work
cd work
git clone $your_favorate_tool
cd $your_favorate_tool
./your_favorate_tool
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="our-solution">Our Solution.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We said &lt;strong>*close*&lt;/strong> to impossible, right? Seeing this clash between the update frequency of some tools and the need (of some people, not everyone) to &amp;ldquo;always have the latest revision of &lt;em>$your_favorate_tool&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;, we came up with an interesting solution. We&amp;rsquo;ve set up an opt-in &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Kali bleeding edge&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; repository which contains daily builds for several useful and frequently updated tools. These repositories are still highly experimental (meaning we expect things to break from time to time until we get more feedback from the community). If you want to try this feature out, you are welcome to add the bleeding edge repository as shown below however, please remember that term &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>bleeding edge&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s a reason for the blood.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">echo deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-bleeding-edge contrib non-free main &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/apt/sources.list
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We currently have a handful of tools in this repository, which include &lt;strong>se-toolkit&lt;/strong> (set), &lt;strong>aircrack-ng&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>dnsrecon&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>sqlmap&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>rfidiot&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>beef-xss&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>libnfc&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>libfreefare&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>mfoc&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>mfcuk&lt;/strong>. We expect this list to grow with time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux Release Aftermath</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-1-release/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-1-release/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-1-release/images/kali-five-days.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;p>Five days into the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-0-release/">Kali Linux&lt;/a> release at BlackHat EU in Amsterdam, and we&amp;rsquo;re still not fully recovered. Since the release, we&amp;rsquo;ve had just over &lt;strong>90,000 downloads&lt;/strong>, a dozen or so package updates, added more articles to the Kali Documentation, started a &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/">Portuguese translation&lt;/a>, and we even managed to squeeze in a small bugfix release (Kali 1.0.1), which resolved an annoying &lt;a href="https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=63/">USB keyboard issue&lt;/a> some users reported. The responses to Kali so far have been extremely positive and our bug tracker is surely enough filling up with new tool requests. We encourage Open-source tool developers to contact us so that we can work together towards this goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have big hopes for our shiny &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/">Kali Linux Documentation&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; platform and will continue writing up useful articles that serve the Kali community. &lt;del>We have made the effort to automatically generate a PDF offline version of our server for public download&lt;/del> (Removed in 2021). &lt;strong>We strongly recommend that even experienced Linux and &lt;a href="https://www.backtrack-linux.org/">BackTrack&lt;/a> users take the time to read through this documentation&lt;/strong>, as Kali Linux has some unique features which would throw off anyone without a proper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. PDF downloads for additional translated languages will become available soon as translation work speeds ahead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved in the past year&amp;rsquo;s development of Kali Linux - &lt;strong>developers, funders, programmers, web designers, translators, community administrators, mirror contributors, and tech writers&lt;/strong>, without whom Kali Linux would not have come to light. Extra special thanks to the &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/">Offensive Security&lt;/a> team who have dedicated themselves to Kali Linux in the past year and to Rapid 7 for &lt;a href="https://blog.rapid7.com/2013/03/13/metasploit-now-supports-kali-linux-the-evolution-of-backtrack/">supporting our release&lt;/a> and officially contributing the Metasploit packages to Kali Linux.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will continue to be responsive to the community through our formal channels, and in turn, hope that through this new interaction, the community will help grow, and continually improve, Kali Linux.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kali Linux 1.0 Release - Moto - The Birth of Kali Linux</title><link>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-0-release/</link><guid>https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-0-release/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-0-release/images/kali-the-birth.jpg" type="image/jpg"/><description>&lt;h2 id="kali-linux-the-rising">Kali Linux, the rising&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been 7 years since we released our first version of &lt;a href="https://www.backtrack-linux.org/">BackTrack Linux&lt;/a>, and the ride so far has been exhilarating. When the dev team started talking about BackTrack 6 (almost a year ago), each of us put on paper a few &amp;ldquo;wish list goals&amp;rdquo; that we each wanted implemented in our &amp;ldquo;next version&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="scrapping-it-all-and-starting-afresh">Scrapping it all and starting afresh&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It soon became evident to us that with our 4 year old development architecture, we would not be able to achieve all these new goals without a massive restructure, so, &lt;strong>we massively restructured&lt;/strong>. We realized it would be easier to start afresh, using new technologies and processes than to try to patch up our existing environment to conform to Debian policies and FSH. This realization brought upon the next question&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ubuntu-vs-debian">Ubuntu vs. Debian&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once we realized we are free from the bonds of our old environment, we started musing about the base platform we want to build our next penetration testing distribution - the main players on our table were Debian and Ubuntu. With both options heavily weighed and gently avoiding philosophical rants about the pros and cons of each, Debian was our final choice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-about-the-offensive-security-courses">What about the Offensive Security courses?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Surprisingly enough, with all the new changes we have made in Kali, the user experience remains pretty much the same. Apart from a couple of path changes due to our new FHS compliance, our students should feel little difference between Kali and BackTrack.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wheres-my-pentest">Where&amp;rsquo;s my /pentest?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Gone. Kaput. Kwisha. Dissipated. FSH compliance has removed the &lt;em>&lt;strong>/pentest&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> structure from our distribution. Although the &lt;em>&lt;strong>/pentest&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> directory tree was a signature of our previous distributions for many years, it always brought with it policy questions which could never be satisfactorily answered. For example, when does a tool go in &lt;em>&lt;strong>/pentest&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>, and when should it be placed in the $PATH? Where should a tool like &amp;ldquo;sqlmap&amp;rdquo; be placed? Should it be in &lt;em>&lt;strong>/pentest/web&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>, or &lt;em>&lt;strong>/pentest/database&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>? With our new FSH compliant packages, there&amp;rsquo;s no guesswork left. Everything is in the path and accessible directly, as it should be.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="kali-linux---whats-in-a-name">Kali Linux - what&amp;rsquo;s in a name?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Hindu Goddess of time and change? Philippine martial art? Cool word in Swahili? None of the above. &amp;ldquo;Kali&amp;rdquo; is simply the name we came up with for our new distribution. Why change the name in the first place? With all these significant changes in our distribution, we felt that we needed to convey this in the project name. &amp;ldquo;BackTrack 6&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t do justice to our efforts in the past year, and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t convey our new message to our users.

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>So, what&amp;rsquo;s the difference between &lt;a href="https://www.backtrack-linux.org/">BackTrack&lt;/a> and Kali?&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; you might be asking. Unfortunately for us, that&amp;rsquo;s not a simple question to answer. It&amp;rsquo;s a mix between &amp;ldquo;everything&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;not much&amp;rdquo;, depending on how you used BackTrack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From an end user perspective, the most obvious change would be the switch to Debian and an FHS-compliant system. What this means is that instead of having to navigate through the &lt;strong>/pentest&lt;/strong> tree, you will be able to call any tool from anywhere on the system as every application is included in the system path. However, there&amp;rsquo;s much hidden magic in that last sentence. I&amp;rsquo;ll quickly list some of the new benefits of this move.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="streaming-security-and-package-updates-from-debian">Streaming Security and Package Updates From Debian&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Our new streamlined repositories synchronize with the &lt;a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian&lt;/a> repositories 4 times a day, constantly providing you with the latest package updates and security fixes available.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="debian-compliant-packaging-of-each-tool-in-kali">Debian Compliant Packaging of Each Tool in Kali&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is where we&amp;rsquo;ve been spending most of our time and effort. Relentlessly packaging dozens of useful tools, painstakingly making sure our packages are Debian compliant.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="long-term-packaging-and-maintenance-of-high-profile-tools">Long Term Packaging and Maintenance of High Profile Tools&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many of the tools in our toolbox need to be &amp;ldquo;bleeding edge&amp;rdquo;. This means we have take on the task of packaging and maintaining upstream versions of many tools, so that our users are constantly kept up to date where it matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="streamlined-development-process">Streamlined Development Process&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As our source packages are now also Debian compliant, you can quickly and easily get the required sources of each tool, then modify and rebuild them with a couple of commands.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="bootstrap-builds-and-iso-customizations">Bootstrap Builds and ISO Customizations&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One of the many benefits of our move to a Debian compliant system, is the ability to Bootstrap a Kali Installation/ISO directly from our repositories. This means that you can easily &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/live-build-a-custom-kali-iso/">build your own customizations of Kali&lt;/a>, as well as perform &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/network-pxe/">enterprise network installs&lt;/a> from a local or remote repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="automating-kali-installations">Automating Kali Installations&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Kali Linux installations can now be automated using pre-seed files. This allows for enterprise wide customization and deployment on multiple systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="real-arm-development">Real ARM Development&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>BackTrack 5 brought with it new support for ARM hardware. Our ARM build-bot was a modified Motorola Xoom tablet, which suffice to say, didn&amp;rsquo;t last for long. To help remedy this, &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/">Offensive Security&lt;/a> has donated a Calxeda ARM cluster to our project, allowing reliable and long term development of Kali Linux ARM images.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="complete-desktop-environment-flexibility">Complete Desktop Environment Flexibility.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Our new build and repository environments allow for complete flexibility in generating your own updated Kali ISOs, with any desktop environment you like. Do you prefer KDE? LXDE? XFCE? Anything else? Then &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/development/live-build-a-custom-kali-iso/">change your Kali desktop environment&lt;/a> yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="seamless-upgrades-between-future-major-versions">Seamless Upgrades Between Future Major Versions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Another benefit derived from the move to a Debian compliant system is the ability to seamlessly upgrade future major version of Kali. No longer will you have to reinstall your penetration testing machine due a new version of Kali coming out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With all these changes (and many more), you can see why we&amp;rsquo;re so excited about this release. Go ahead and give Kali a spin. Head on to the &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/">documentation area&lt;/a> for some setup guides, and then over to our &lt;a href="https://forums.kali.org/">forums&lt;/a> and join the new Kali community!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
